# The dotuser ID

A special user called `dotuser` is automatically created for IPDR. Use this to login. 


## The dotuser

When you login with the `dotuser` ID you are taken to a purpose built IPDR Dashboard where you submit and view queries in a easy clutter free manner.


The default password is `[you should have received it or contact us via email]` 


:::warning Change password for dotuser on first login
You are strongly urged to immediately change the default password of the special user named 'dotuser' on first login.
