# Latitude Longitude

The latitude and longitude associated with an IP address can be dynamically determined by tracking its corresponding Terminal ID, which updates as the device moves and its location changes. Upon querying the IP address, its latitude and longitude can be extracted by leveraging an API to retrieve the Terminal ID and its associated current latitude and longitude data.

Imagine a satellite serving multiple IP addresses (e.g., 10 IPs) can provide real-time geolocation updates for each IP address. As each IP device moves, its corresponding Terminal ID is dynamically updated, enabling the extraction of its current latitude and longitude through an API query.
