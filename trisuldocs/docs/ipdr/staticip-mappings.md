# Customer Inventory Mappings

The IPDR Customers list provides a comprehensive repository of customer details. Basically tells how to add customer information, so that they are automatically filled into the output EXCEL report.This feature allows authorized users to:

   **Add**: Create new customer entries with detailed information  
   **Edit**: Update existing customer records as needed  
   **Delete**: Remove customer entries from the list  

   :::tip
You can also add customer information for static IP and usernames using the [Trisul IPDR API](api) . 
:::

## Compliance Requirement

The DoT compliance letter clearly mentions that the following details need to be provided in the output report.  These are called CAF fields. CAF stands for Customer Acquisition Form.

:::info  Static vs AAA customers
This feature is most useful for the static IP customers of the ISP. Because the inventory is more stable than large scale ISP providing residiential services. For the latter, talk to us to use a REST API to get the fields
:::

Adding customer details for static IP customers can be done in two methods

- Automatically use a REST API â€“ contact us offline for this
- Enter each mapping or upload a CSV file containing all static IP to customer mappings

## Manually Add Static IP Mappings

## Delete All

To delete all the details of the customers, click on the *Delete All* button on the top right corner. You cannot recover the details of the customers once deleted. 

## Action Button

Click on the action button against each customer to *edit*, *delete*, or *add/edit subnets*

### Add/Edit Subnets

To manage subnets and terminal IDs, click on the *Add/Edit Subnets* option from the action button dropdown. This will prompt you to enter the following details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| IP Subnet | Enter the IP subnet address in CIDR notation 
| Valid From | Select the date from which the subnet will be valid from. |
| Terminal ID | Enter the unique identifier for the terminal device associated with the subnet. |

![](images/ipsubnet_terminalid.png)
*Figure: Showing IPDR Customers terminal IDs with subnets*

Below that are the list of assigned subnets to customer containing details such as 

| Column| Descriptions |
|--------|--------------|
| IP Subnet | Displays the IP subnet in CIDR notation. |
| Valid from | Shows the data from which the subnet invalid. |
| Valid to | Displays the date until which the subnet is valid. By default it is set to "not set" indicating perpetual validity. |
| Terminal ID | Lists the unique identifier for the terminal device associated with the assigned subnet |


:::info Dont delete customers, use Set Expiry
The Static IP mapping captures the validity of the assignment via the *Valid From* and *Valid To* fields. While generating the IPDR Report , Trisul IPDR uses the *Valid From* and *Valid To* timestamps to fill out the customer details. Users should do a *Set Expiry* for decommissioned customers rather than *Delete* them. This allows historical mappings to be correctly filled out as per the compliance mandate. 
:::

Click on the action button against a subnet for two options say
1) Set Expiry
2) Delete

Click on *Set Expiry* to set "Valid to" date for the selected subnet that shows the flows until the set expiry date but not the customer details in the report. Click *Delete* to delete that particular subnet.
