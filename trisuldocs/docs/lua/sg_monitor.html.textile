h1. Session Group Monitor

<span class='label label-info'>BACKEND SCRIPT</span>

Monitor flow based metrics stream. When new flows are created, terminated, timeout, new activity is seen on flows, etc. You can also control which flows get flushed to the Trisul-Hub database. 

h2. Structure 

<div class='lua_skeletons' data-file='session_monitor' data-name='Session Group Monitor'></div>

h2. Table @sg_monitor@

The Lua table @sg_monitor = {..}@  can contain one or more of the following handler functions. 

|_. field |_. type |_. when called |
| session_guid | String (optional) | Session group id. The default is @{99A78737-4B41-4387-8F31-8077DB917336}@ for IPv4/IPv6 flows |

h2. Objects Reference

h2. Flow  

Represents a flow and all its metrics. Note that you can access the @f:flow()@ "object":obj_flowid.html which gives you access to the tuples like source_ip, destination_ip, ports, etc. 

|_. field |_. return type |_. description |
|key| string| A unique string identifying the flow. Same as @flow():id()@ below |
|flow | "FlowID":obj_flowid.html | a FlowID object representing the flow tuples like source_ip, port, destination_ip, port etc |
|time_window| number,number|  start and last activity time seconds (a tv_sec Unix epoch time) of the flow. @starttm,lasttm = flow:time_window()@.  |
|state| "flow state":#session_state| The state of the flow, whether it is timeout, RST, FIN, or closed normally. |
|az_bytes| number | number of bytes in a->z direction. the A-side can be obtained from @session:flow():ipa_readable()@ |
|za_bytes| bytes seen in z->a direction |
|az_packets | number |number packets seen in a->z direction |
|za_packets | number |number packets seen in z->a direction |
|az_payload_bytes| number |a->z payload bytes does not include the network headers, only the TCP payload |
|za_payload_bytes| number |z->a payload bytes does not include the network headers, only the TCP payload |
|tags| string |a pipe separated string of all tags attached to the flow |
|add_tag| - | Example @flow:add_tag("suspect")@  allows you to add a tag to the set of tags already there. 
<span class='label label-warning'>USAGE NOTE</span>
When to use  @add_tag@ vs "@engine:tag_flow(..)@":obj_engine.html#function_tag_flow  When writing _session_group_monitor_ plugins you want to use @add_tag@ because it directly modifies the flow tag. @tag_flow(..)@ sends the new flowtag as a message back to the streaming analytics pipeline, the tag can be lost if the flow is terminated or flushed before the flowtag message is processed by the flusher.|
|setup_rtt| number | For TCP flows only - Round Trip Time in *microseconds* as measured by the TCP handshake |
|retransmissions| number| Number of retransmitted sequence numbers observed, total of both directions |

h2. Session state

The state field from the above object contains an *OR* of the following enums 


|SESS_INIT|0x0001|all connections have this bit |
|SESS_SEEN_SYN|0x0002 | seen a SYN (of the 3-way handshake) |
|SESS_SEEN_SYN_ACK|0x0004|seen a SYN_ACK |
|SESS_SEEN_SYN_ACK_ACK|0x0008|seen ACK of the SYN-ACK the handshake |
|SESS_A_END_SERVER|0x0010|The A-Endpoint identified by @flow@ is the destination. The Trisul formula is to place the lower numbered port endpoint as the Z-End. Using this information you can identify the client and server of the flow based on the actual SYN packet|
|SESS_Z_END_SERVER|0x0020|The Z-Endpoint is the server. This is the normal situation |
|SESS_SEEN_FIN|0x0040|Seen a FIN close|
|SESS_SEEN_RST|0x0080|Seen a RST close|
|SESS_TIMEDOUT|0x0100|Flow timed out, could indicate packet loss or other issue|
|SESS_ERROR|0x0200|Some other unknown error with flow caused it to flush|
|SESS_INCOMPLETE|0x0400|One of the two directions did not close properly|
|SESS_TERMINATED|0x0800|Proper termination|
|SESS_FLOWEND|0x09C0|Use this to detect flows that are closed and flushed to the database.  In-progress flows that flush periodically will be skipped by this mask.  Alias for SESS_TERMINATED or SESS_TIMEDOUT or SESS_SEEN_FIN or SESS_SEEN_RST  | 

h3. Example use of object

The following example prints the IP address of endpoints and total bytes

<pre>

  onnewflow = function(engine, newflow)
    local flow_object = newflow:flow()

    print("ip a-end"..flow_object:ipa_readable())
    print("ip z-end"..flow_object:ipz_readable())
    print("total bytes"..newflow:az_bytes()+newflow:za_bytes())

    ..

  end,

</pre>

h2. Functions Reference


h2. Function @onnewflow@


h3. Purpose   

Use this to collect flow based metrics.

h3. When called

When a new flow is detected. A new flow is detected when a metric for a new flow key is updated and that flow key is not currently being tracked in the streaming backend. 

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| flow | A "Flow":#flow  object | the flow |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example

----------

h2. Function @onupdate@

p(autohint info-circle danger).  
*High frequency function*
For busy networks this can result in thousands of updates every second. Keep your LUA function @onupdate(..)@  efficient and avoid I/O or blocking.

h3. Purpose   

Used to track all streaming metrics assigned to a flow. 

h3. When called

This is called when any event or metric is detected on a flow. 

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| flow | A "Flow":#flow  object | the flow |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example

----------

h2. Function @onterminate@


h3. Purpose   

When a flow is terminated. The termination can be a normal TCP termination or a timeout. 

h3. When called

When a normal TCP flow termination is detected or when the flow is timedout from the streaming data structures.



h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| flow | A "Flow":#flow  object | the flow |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example

----------

h2. Function @onbeginflush@


h3. Purpose   

Use this to setup your code to handle the start of flows being flushed to the backend storage. 


h3. When called

When accumulated streaming metrics for all flows are about to be flushed to the backend.


h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| timestamp | A timestamp (tv_sec) value |  timestamp value - number of seconds since Jan 1 1970  |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example


----------

h2. Function @onflush@

h3. Purpose   

Process each flow as they are flushed. 

h3. When called

Just before each flow is flushed to the backend database. At this point all the metrics are attached to the flow and ready for consumption. 

p(autohint info-circle danger).  
*Long running flows*
Long running flows can be flushed multiple times, by default every 300 seconds/5 minutes.  Use the "flow:state()":#session_state to filter them out if you want to process only terminated flows. 

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| flow | A "Flow":#flow  object | the flow |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example


----------

h2. Function @flushfilter@


h3. Purpose   

Control if a flow is flushed to the database backend or not.

h3. When called

Just before each flow is flushed to the database. You can look at the contents of the flow object and determine if you want this flow to be flushed or not.


h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| flow | A "Flow":#flow  object | the flow |

h3. Return value

- true := flush this flow to the backend database node
- false := dont flush this flow 

h4. Voting considerations 

If you have multiple scripts _S1, S2, .. SN_ each voting differently on @flushfilter()@, the following rule is enforced. 

# *ALL scripts have to vote NO* to flush  by returning false. 
# Even if one script _Sx_ returns YES or does not implement @flushfilter()@, the artifact is flushed. 


h3. Example


----------

h2. Function @onendflush@


h3. Purpose   

End of a flush cycle. 

h3. When called

When all the flows are flushed for this cycle. You can clean up here what you initalized in @onbeginflush@ 


h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example

----------

h2. Function @onmetronome@


h3. Purpose   

Plug into a metronome.

h3. When called

If you define a onmetronome(..) function you will be plugged into the Trisul metronome heartbeat mechanism. This method will be called every metronome tick(roughly every second).  The context in which this method is called is threadsafe and you can add metrics to the Engine from here. 


h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| timestamp | Number | Current timestamp (tv_sec epoch seconds) |
