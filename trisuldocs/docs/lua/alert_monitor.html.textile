h2. Object alert   


|_. field |_. return type |_. description |
|timestamp| number,number | The time when the item was seen. Seconds in @tv_sec@ format, and Microseconds @tv_usec@. <pre> local secs=alert:timestamp()          -- if you only want seconds
local secs,usecs=alert:timestamp()    -- if you want seconds, usecs
local printable = os.date('%c', secs) -- if you want printable 
</pre>  |

h2. Functions Reference


h2. Function @onnewalert@


h3. Purpose   

Handle a new alert.

h3. When called

Immediately upon receiving a new alert.  

h3. Parameters

| engine | A "Backend Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, alerts, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| alert | A "alert":#object_alert object | the alert |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example



h2. Function @onbeginflush@



h3. Purpose   

Prepare for alert flushes to Trisul Hub Database.

h3. When called

When an alert flush operation is about to start. The sequence is  _onbeginflush_ , _onflush()_,_onflush()_.. _onendflush()_  

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, alerts, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| timestamp | Timestamp | Timestamps seconds @tv_sec@ |


h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example


h2. Function @onflush@


h3. Purpose   

Custom processing before each alert is flushed. Perhaps write to your own tools or logfiles.

h3. When called

Just before each alert is flushed to the database. The maximum delay between getting a @onnewalert@ and a corresponding @onflush(..)@ for that alert is 60 seconds. 

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, alerts, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| alert | An "alert":#object_alert object | the alert |

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example




h2. Function @flushfilter@


h3. Purpose   

Allows you to control if an alert is flushed to the database or ignored.


h3. When called

Just before an alert is about to be flushed to the database. 


h3. Parameters

| engine | An "engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, alerts, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| alert | An "alert":#object_alert object | the alert |

h3. Return value


- true := flush this alert to the backend database node
- false := dont flush this alert 


h3. Example




h2. Function @onendflush@


h3. Purpose   

Wrap up a sequence of flush operations. You can do some cleanup operations here.


h3. When called

When all the alerts in this timeslice have been flushed to the database.

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, alerts, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| timestamp | Timestamp | Timestamps seconds @tv_sec@ |


h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example


----------

h2. Function @onmetronome@


h3. Purpose   

Plug into a metronome.

h3. When called

If you define a onmetronome(..) function you will be plugged into the Trisul metronome heartbeat mechanism. This method will be called every metronome tick(roughly every second).  The context in which this method is called is threadsafe and you can add metrics to the Engine from here. 


h3. Parameters

| engine | An "Engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, resources, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| timestamp | Number | Current timestamp (tv_sec epoch seconds) |
| tick_count | Number | An incremeting tick counter |
| tick_interval | Number | The tick interval, in seconds. |

h3. Return value
