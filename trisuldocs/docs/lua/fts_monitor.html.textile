h1. FTS Monitor

<span class='label label-info'>BACKEND SCRIPT</span>

FTS stands for Full Text Search documents. These are extracted by Trisul and _fts_monitor_ scripts can look at them and perform custom processing. 

Currently there are only two FTS doc types built in to Trisul

# HTTP Headers - same format as on the wire 
# SSL Certificates fully decoded as text - same structure as OpenSSL text dump of certificates

h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example


--------


h2. Function @onbeginflush@

When a stream window closes and _before_ all the FTS documents in this window are about to be flushed to the Hub node.

h3. Purpose   

Signal begin of data flushing window.

h3. When called

Before FTS documents are flushed to the hub node. 

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, FTSs, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| timestamp | Timestamp | Timestamps seconds @tv_sec@ |


h3. Return value

Ignored

h3. Example



-------


h2. Function @onflush@


h3. Purpose   

FTS doc flush event.

h3. When called

Before each FTS doc is flushed to the hub node. 

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, FTSs, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| FTS | An "FTS object":#fts | the FTS document |

h3. Example


---------------


h2. Function @flushfilter@


h3. Purpose   

To control whether you want to flush a particular FTS document or not.

h3. When called

Before each FTS document is flushed. 
If you return @false@ from this method, the "onflush"#function_onflush will never be called. 

h3. Parameters

| engine | An "engine":obj_engine.html object |  use this object to add metrics, FTSs, or alerts into the Trisul framework |
| FTS | A "FTS object":#fts | the FTS document|

h3. Return value


- true := flush this FTS to the backend database node
- false := dont flush this FTS, drop it

p(autohint lightbulb-o info).  
If you return false in all cases,  then no FTS documents will be saved to the backend.


h3. Example


-----


h2. Function @onendflush@


h3. Purpose   

Handle cleanup and summarization after all documents have been flushed in the streaming analysis window (default 1 minute)
