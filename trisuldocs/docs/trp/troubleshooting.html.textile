If you want to accept connections to your server from any IP, add this line to the ACLItem in the "trisulConfig.xml":/docs/ref/trisulconfig.html file.

<code>
<ACLItem Address="0.0.0.0" Mask="0.0.0.0"/>
</code>

Currently a maximum of 64MB of PCAP can be retrieved via TRP. If you wish to get a bigger PCAP logon to the server directly and use the _trisul_dpitool_ command.
