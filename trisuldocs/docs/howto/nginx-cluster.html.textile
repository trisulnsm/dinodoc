h1. Customizing the web server stack 


The default install of Webtrisul comes with 5 instances of __thin__ servers with a __nginx__ reverse proxy. This should be sufficient for many sites, but you can increase the number of servers if 
  * you experience sluggishness 
  * if you have many simultaneous users

h2. How to increase the number of backend __thin__ servers 

The configuration files are stored in @/usr/local/share/webtrisul/build@

Make the following changes in these files

|nginx.conf  |Add names of additional servers sequentially in the upstream thin_cluster section. Counting starts at 0.  |
|thin-nginxd.conf  |Update the NO_OF_SERVERS to what you want  |
|thin-config.yml  |Update the variable _servers_ to match in other files.  |
