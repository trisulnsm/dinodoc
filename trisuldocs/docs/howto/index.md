# Howtos

All four Trisul products run on the same core architecture, so the Admin and User Guides are unified for all the users. The documentation spans the full platform, and you may occasionally see features outside your specific product which is simply a reflection of Trisul’s integrated and advanced design.

So this section is a collection of short, actionable how-to guides for common Trisul workflows. If you were wondering "Where do I find this?”, “How do I enable that?”, or “What should I check next?", want a quick answer, not a deep manual, you’re in the right place. These list of HowTos are your quick reference ✨
