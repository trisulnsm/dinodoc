h1. HTTP Header FTS

All HTTP headers including requests (GET, POST,..etc) and responses (HTTP OK, errors ) are stored in the FTS index. 

h2. What is stored ?

The entire HTTP request or response body is treated as a single document. All fields are stored in the index except the following which have high variability. You can generate reports by User-Agent, Server, Content-Type, or any of the fields in the HTTP Header.

The following HTTP fields are excluded from the index.
