h2. Searching

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Click on Resources -> DNS Resources

# Open the Search Criteria box by clicking on "Show"
# Tabs "Search by endpoints" or "Search by regex"

h3. Search by endpoints

You can search by 

# IP
# Exclude these IPS
# Pair of IPs
# Port
# Timeframe
# Regex Pattern
# Invert Regex Pattren


h3. Search by regex

You can search by a single regular expression or bulk substring matching.

h4. A single perl compatible regex

Enter a single regex in the Pattern box. It must be on a single line.

For example @v16.cache?.*youtube.com$@ will match @tc.v16.cache8.c.youtube.com@  but not @v16.cache18.c.youtube.com@


h4. Multiple patterns for substring matches 

Enter a list of patterns one per line.

Use this if you want to search for hundreds of domains at once. This is a substring match so you cannot use any regexes.
