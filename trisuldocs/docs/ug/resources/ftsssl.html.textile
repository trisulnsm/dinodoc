h1. SSL Certificates FTS

All SSL Certificate chains are stored in the full text index.



h2. What is stored ?

Every SSL/TLS server presents its credentials at the time of initial handshake by transferring its certificate. In addition to its own certificate, it also passes along a chain of certificates ending up in a trusted root. Trisul decodes the X509v3 certificates and stores the entire certificate chain, not just individual certificates as a separate document.  You can still search for individual certificates but the chain is the document.

p(autohint flag danger). 
The entire certificate chain is the document.


In addition, Trisul stores the following extra fields in the FTS index
# *chain_depth_x* - the number of certificates in the chain
# *DERSHA1* - a hash of each ASN DER certificate in the chain
# *PUBKEYSHA1* - a hash of the public key of each certificate. This is a hash of only the subjectPublicKey string and does not include the algorithm part. See "RFC3280":http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt

h2. Using 

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select Resources -> SSL Certificate FTS

Then follow instructions in the "FTS":fts.html documentation.

p(autohint lightbulb-o).
SSL Certificates are also in the normal index. Use that to do a bulk search for SHA1 hashes from intelligence feeds.


h2. Special tips for SSL Certificate FTS

h4. Special attributes

Use the special attributes

# chain_depth_x -> Search for chain_depth_1 to locate possible self signed certificates
# PUBKEY and DERSHA -> Use them to search for particular certificates. 
# CN (Common Name) -> a great place to start looking and for narrowing your queries

A sample faceted results, the common name field is a good place to start
