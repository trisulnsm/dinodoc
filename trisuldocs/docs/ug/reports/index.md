# Reports

Trisul comes with dozens of pre-defined reports for your use. You can
 either view them on the browser or send them via email periodically.

#### Creating Your Own Reports

Using the [Trisul Remote Protocol API](/docs/trp) you can write Ruby scripts that create your own reports.

## Report Time

For each report type, you can easily select a number of predefined time windows.

The Time Selector feature enables you to define a temporal scope for report generation, with a default setting of the most recent 15 minutes. Once a time window is selected, it remains fixed for generating all the reports on the page and their associated drill-downs. You can choose from a range of pre-defined time ranges, including:

- Last 1 hour

- Last 24 hours

- This month

- Last month and more.

Alternatively, you can specify a custom date range by selecting the *Custom Range* option, which allows for the selection of a specific period from the past.
