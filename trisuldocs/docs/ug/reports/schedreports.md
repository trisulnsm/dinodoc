2. In addition enter report parameters as shown below

`filter_interface_average_utilization : 75`

### Parameters for the Endpoint Activity Report

The *Endpoint activity report* expects you to specify a host.

1. Specify all common fields for a scheduled report
2. In addition enter report parameters as shown below

Say you want to schedule an endpoint report for host 192.168.1.151, enter the ip address in this format  
`{"IP":"192.168.1.151"}` You can also enter a host name instead of an IP like `{"IP":"dns00.unleashnetworks.com"}`
