h1. Manage Alert Groups

An "Alert Group" represents a type of alert. Trisul ships with 6 Alert groups 

# Threshold Crossing Alerts :  Based on a meter value exceeding fixed Hi and Lo water marks for a certain time
# Flow Tracking Alerts :  Anomalous flow behaviour you define
# IDS Alerts : When interfacing with external IDS systems  like Suricata 
# Blacklist : When triggered by blacklisted indicators 
# Threshold Band Alerts : When a meter value drifts outside a "trained" band of normal values
# System Alerts : From Trisul self monitoring, packet drops, memory pressure etc.

You can create your own alert types using the "alertgroup LUA API":/docs/lua/alert_group.html Alert groups you create using the LUA API will also show up in Trisul and be managed along with the built in alert groups.


h2. Viewing alert groups

To view all alert groups currently in the system.


p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Login as Admin -> Select Context and profile -> Under Alerts -> View Alert Groups



h3. Enable and disable alerts

You can enable or disable entire alert groups by pressing the "Enable" or "Disable" button shown on each row.

When alerts are disabled, it just means that any alerts generated by Trisul or plugins will be ignored by the streaming analytics engine.  This means the alerts wont be stored, displayed, or available to your LUA plugins.


h3. Forward alerts to syslog

Forwarding alerts to syslog is used for

# By the Trisul Email dispatching service to send alerts via email to you  
# To send to other systems 

For each alert type you can choose the Syslog policy by

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
From the Alert Groups table -> Select a Syslog Level -> Select DISABLED to prevent sending to syslog



h2. Viewing and forwarding alerts 

The alerts generated appear immediately on the user interface. You can also setup the following 

# Sending alerts to "SYSLOG
# Send alerts via "email":email_settings.html
# Send alerts via "SMS service":sms_settings.html

p(autohint exclamation-triangle danger). The Email and SMS services work by reading the SYSLOG alerts. Ensure SYSLOG forwarding is enabled for each alert type.
