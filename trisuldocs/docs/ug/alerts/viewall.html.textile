h1.  Summary of all alerts

There are many different types of alerts supported by Trisul.  In addition to built in alert types you can add your own types using the Lua plugin mechanism.

This page describes how you can get an overview of alert activity across all types.


h2. The top alert bar 

On top of every page there is an alert bar which shows near real time alert counts. These numbers show only _new_ alert counts you last saw it.
