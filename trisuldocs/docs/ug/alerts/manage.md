# Manage Alert Groups

An “**Alert Group**” represents a type of alert. Trisul is pre-configured with [7 alert types](/docs/ug/alerts/#types-of-alerts-in-trisul). Each *Alert Group* serves as the logical container for organizing and managing alerts based on their respective types. This section explains how admins can manage individual *alert groups* and configure them in the [*Admin panel*](/docs/ag/ui/adminlayout).


> **For Developers**: You can create your own alert types using the [alertgroup LUA API](/docs/lua/alert_group). *Alert groups* you create using the LUA API will also show up in Trisul and be managed along with the built in alert groups.

## Alert Groups Page Overview

### View Alert Groups

*Figure: Enable or Disable Alert Group*

When alerts are disabled, it just means that any alerts generated by 
Trisul or plugins will be ignored by the streaming analytics engine. 
This means the alerts wont be stored, displayed, or available to your LUA plugins.

### Edit Alert Group

You can edit the alert group details by clicking on the option button against each alert group. And click Edit.

### Forward Alerts to Syslog

In Trisul, SYSLOG forwarding allows alerts to be sent to a SYSLOG server for centralized logging and analysis including,

1. Logging of email dispatching service to send alerts via email to you
2. Logging of alerts to send to other systems

You can configure the level of severity indicating the level of importance of each alert by selecting from the *Send to syslog/email* drop down menu in the *Alert Groups Edit* form.

Select DISABLED if you would like to prevent sending alerts to SYSLOG and Select ALERTS which ll automatically start sending alerts.

> Once you have clicked ALERTS it is mandatory to restart the probe using [Start/Stop Tasks](/docs/ag/admintasks/startstop)
