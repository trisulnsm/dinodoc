# Flow Tracker Alerts

Having previously configured [*Flow Trackers*](/docs/ug/flow/tracker) as described in our prior documentation, we will now proceed to outline the procedures for generating alerts based on these *Flow Trackers*. This section will focus on the creation and configuration of **Flow Tracker Alerts**, that enables the detection of specific flow activity and triggers notifications in response to pre configured threshold criteria.

## Overview
Trisul provides a powerful way to generate an alert when certain types of flow activity occurs.
Once configured, *Flow Tracker Alerts* can be triggered in near real-time (latency of 1-5 seconds) prompting notifications via:
- [Web Interface Alert Tracker](/docs/ug/ui/userlayout#alerts-and-notifications) (located in the top-right corner)
- Email notifications
- SMS (Text Message) notifications

## Applications

You can use *Flow Tracker Alerts* to be notified when a number of things happen. Some typical examples include,

1. When anyone *uploads* anything over 10MB from your network
2. When anyone establishes a long lived session more than 1 hour out of your network
3. When anyone *downloads* anything over 1G into your network

## Configuration of Flow Tracking Alerts

To Configure *Flow Tracking Alerts*, Login as `user`,

:::info navigation
:point_right: Select Alerts&rarr; Flow Tracking&rarr; Configure
:::

Or you can create *Flow Tracker Tracker Alerts* per probe.

For that, Login as `admin` user to create *Flow Tracker Alerts*.

:::info navigation
:point_right: Select *Context : default*&rarr; profile0&rarr; Alerts&rarr; Flow Tracker 
:::

### Create New Flow Tracker Alert

Click on **Create a New Flow Tracker Alert**

Filling in this form enables you to create an alert condition on a flow tracker. Find the fields and their description below to fill in the form.

| Field                              | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alert Name                         | A unique name for the alert                                                |
| Select a Flow Tracker              | Which tracker, see section on Flow Trackers                                |
| Threshold Value (Bytes or Seconds) | For data xfer based trackers. Specify number of bytes. Eg 10MB, 6K, 2000 (default units = bytes). For Time based trackers like Long Lived flows. Specify number of seconds                  |
| Priority                           | Alert Priority (1=HIGH, 2=MEDIUM, 3=LOW)                                   |
| Alert Message                      | Message shown as part of the alert                                         |

Once providing all the details in the form, click *Create*. Now you have created a new *Flow Tracker Alert*.

### View Generated Alerts

There are couple of ways to see flow alerts that fired. To view the generated alerts,

:::info navigation
:point_right: Go to Alerts&rarr; Flow Tracking
:::
Or 
:::info navigation
