# Summary of All Alerts

Trisul provides two convenient ways to view a summary of all alerts:
1) [*Alert Bar*](/docs/ug/alerts/viewall#the-alert-bar) ( Top right corner of every page)
2) [*Show All*](/docs/ug/alerts/viewall#the-show-all-alerts) Alerts

>There are many different types of alerts supported by Trisul. In 
addition to built in alert types you can add your own types using the 
Lua plugin mechanism.

## The Alert Bar

The *Alert Bar* is located in the top right corner of every page on the [User's Layout](/docs/ug/ui/userlayout).
