p(autohint info-circle danger). 
*This feature requires the Trisul Badfellas plugin*
See "Trisul Badfellas":/docs/ug/install/badfellas.html


The Trisul Badfellas plugin adds comprehensive threat detection capabilities to Trisul based on multiple blacklists which are included with the plugin

Some of the alerts 
  # Communication with known malicious IPs
  # Retrieving malware from malicious URLs

h2.  Evasions

  * Both DNS requests and replies are checked for any malicious domains
  * Minor permutations in domains and URLs are automatically handled.
