h1.  Routers and Interfaces 

The main tool you will need to work with *Device level* views of Netflow is the _*Routers and Interfaces*_ tool.  You can select a timeframe, then you will be shown a list of routers with traffic summaries, then you can select a router and see the interfaces, finally you can monitor the interface itself or drilldown even further into hosts , applications, flows on that interface. You can even pull up a Real Time  stabber of any of the drilldowns. 


p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
To access Routers and Interfaces : Select  Netflow -> Routers and Interfaces

h2.  Using the router interface tool 

The screen has 4 major parts,

# *Time Selector* -- select a timewindow for the analysis. The default is the most recent 15 minutes. Once you select the time window, that is fixed for all the subsequent drilldowns. Dont be afraid to select large time windows. Trisul can handle it.
# *Router Table* -- table showing list of all routers active in the selected time window. Table shows the number of interfaces active, total volume pushed through the router and other info.
# *Magic Map* -- a visualization of the top interfaces *across all routers* allows you to directly select an interface. This is also useful to get a view of the relative volumes seen by interfaces across your network.
# *Interfaces Table* -- when you click on a router, the interface table is filled with details about all the interfaces on that router active in the selected time window.
# *Interface Alias* -- whe you want to know the alias name or interface peering details, you can select the 'Show Interface Alias' option.

From the interface table there are a number of drilldown options available.


h2. Drilldown from the interfaces table

Having selected a router and interface you can drilldown and access the following by Clicking on the "Options" link
