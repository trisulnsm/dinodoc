If you want the raw webserver log it can be found on the Trisul Hub server at @/usr/local/var/log/trisul-hub/webtrisul@
The files are named production.log or productionssl.log (if you are running webtrisul on HTTPS)

Also see trisbashrc:"/docs/ref/trisbashrc.html" which contains helper aliases to locate various log files on the probe and hub server systems.
