h2. Configuring FTP 


h3. Create key pair on Trisul IPDR Hub node 

On the Trisul-Hub server create a key pair like so into a file that is used for Trisul IPDR only. Use a file name @id_trisul_ipdr@

You can do these steps in the @/usr/local/etc/trisul-hub@ directory

<pre class="language-bash">
cd /usr/local/etc/trisul-hub 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):  id_trisul_ipdr
# do not give passwords 
</pre>

Now you will have the key pair saved in the current directory 

<pre class="language-bash">
id_trisul_ipdr.pub      # the public key  (to be send to the target FTP server)
id_trisul_ipd           # the private key (never to be shared, stored on Trisul-Hub)
</pre>


h3. Save the public key on the target server

Now put the @id_trisul_ipdr.pub@ on to the target server with the @Username@ in the IPDR FTP Settings.

<pre class="language-bash">

# on the target server append to authorized_keys

cat id_trisul_ipdr.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys 

</pre>

h4. Test it out 

On the Trisul-Hub node check if the server works. You can use the ssh command to test.

<pre class="language-bash">

# ensure username@ip matches the FTP settings 

ssh -i /usr/local/etc/trisul-hub/id_trisul_ipdr  dotuser@10.179.210.1 

# if it logs in we are set 
</pre>
