h1. Disk usage alerts  

This page describes how to get email alerts when disk usage exceeds a certain threshold. 

p(autohint info-circle info). 
By default disk usage alerting is not enabled.

h2. Pre-requisites

Before you enable disk usage alerts you need to do two things.

- Setup Email := specify outgoing email server credentials. see "Setup Email":/docs/ug/reports/emailsettings.html 
- Enable email alert delivery := allow alert delivery via email see "Email alert delivery":/docs/ug/alerts/email_settings.html#basic_steps_to_enable_email_alerts


h2. Edit configuration files

To enable disk alert threshold, you need to edit the hub and probe configuration files. 

h3. Setup disk usage thresholds on Hub node

Edit the "trisulHubConfig.xml":/docs/ref/trisulhubconfig.html file and set the following parameters under SlicePolicy.

- UsageRedMark := represents the percent usage threshold of disk.  Here it is shown to be 90.

Similarly set threshold values for all three storage areas, oper/ref/archive. You can set them all to the same value if they are mounted on the same storage volume.

<pre class='language-xml'>
<code>
   <SlicePolicy>
        <SliceWindow>DAILY</SliceWindow>

        <Operational>
            <SliceCount>32</SliceCount>
            <UsageRedMark>90</UsageRedMark>
        </Operational>
</code>
</pre>

h3. Setup disk usage thresholds on Probe node

Edit the "trisulProbeConfig.xml":/docs/ref/trisulconfig.html file and set the following value.

- UsageRedMark := the disk percent threshold value for the probe node


<pre class='language-xml'>
<code>
    <UsageRedMark>90</UsageRedMark>
</code>
</pre>


h2. Viewing alerts


When disk usage crosses the thresholds set an "User Alert" will be generated. 


p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select _Alerts > All Alerts  -> User Alerts_

These alerts are also delivered instantly via E-mail.

A sample alert shows the current usage, the partition, the threshold usage and the directory root.
