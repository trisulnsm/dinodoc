h1.  Packet capture settings 

A single instance of Trisul can listen on one or more network interfaces. This page describes how you can add or edit packet capture parameters for any profile.  

h2. View list of capture profiles

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Login as admin and Select _Context : default > profile0 -> Capture Adapters_
 
By default, only *eth0* is enabled.  There are some other disabled entries for debugging purposes. If you want to listen on, say eth1 you can create a new profile and enable that one. 

h2. Create a new capture profile

Say you want to create a new network adapter for profile0 in context0. 

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select _Context : default > profile0 -> Capture Adapters_
Click **Create New Profile**  

A form with the following fields are displayed 

|_.Field|_.Description|
|Name |A unique name for this profile|
|Description|A short description of the profile|
|Interface| The linux network interface name - such as _eth0_, _eth1_, _wlan0_ |
|BPF Filter|A BPF (libpcap/tcpdump) filter expression (see "notes below":#specifying_a_bpf_filter_for_afpacket_and_rxring on how to generate this for rxring mode - the default) |
|Add Ethernet FCS|Add 4 byte FCS to packet length. Use to option to reconcile with SNMP based counters.|
|Force Netflow Mode|Force this adapter into Netflow Mode - use this option if you want to use a mix of Netflow and Packet capture on a per-adapter basis. |
|Enable ERSPAN|Decapsulate all ERSPAN packets on this interface. If this option is disabled, ERSPAN is counted as a single IP+GRE tunnel.|


h3. Provider specific options

Trisul can capture packets in two "four modes", _Linux RX Ring_ , _Libpcap_ , _PF Ring_ ,_AF Packet_,_Napatech_ . You dont control the run mode here, but at the command line or by changing the application settings. The capture profiles work for all run modes, with one exception. 

h4. RX Ring

!images/rx_ring.png!

- Number of blocks (2^N) := Number of slots in the ring. Increase only if you need to
  
h4. Libpcap

!images/libpcap.png!

- Promiscuous Mode := Usually set to true
- Snap length := How many bytes of each packet to capture


h4. PF Ring

!images/pf_ring.png!

- PF Ring Cluster ID := Cluster ID to which this PF_RING socket is attached. (Numeric)

h4. AF Packet

!images/af_packet.png!

- AF Packet FANOUT Group ID := AF Packet Fanout Group ID for flow based load balancing (Numeric < 1000)

h4. Napatech

!images/napatech.png!

- Stream ID := Numeric number
- Hashing mode := how packets are distributed across streams
- Stream config := Full NTPL command.




h2. Specifying a BPF Filter for AFPACKET and RXRING 

You need to enter BPF filter slightly differently for RX_RING adapters.

h4. Filter for Libpcap

Just directly enter a *tcpdump* compatible expression, such as @not host 192.168.1.22@

h4. Filter for RX Ring

You need to enter the *tcpdump bytecode* instead of just the expression. To do so, open a linux command line, then use @tcpdump -ddd <expression>@ and paste the output into the BPF Filter box.  Here is an example.

<pre class="language-bash">

[root@localhost trunk]$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -ddd not host 192.168.1.22
14
40 0 0 12
21 0 4 2048
32 0 0 26

21 0 1 3232235798
6 0 0 0
