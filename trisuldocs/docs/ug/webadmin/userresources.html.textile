h1. User Resources

User resources allow you to assign network devices, interfaces, IP addresses, IP subnets or any other network entity to named groups. These groups can then be assigned to users. Users will then only be allowed to see those resource entities.

h3. Use case - user device permissions

A Trisul netflow customer desires to create _cust1_ who can only view _routers A,B,C_ metrics and another user _cust2_ who can only see _routers X,Y_

# Create a resource group called _custgroup1_ and select routers A,B,C
# Create a resource group called _custgroup2_ and select routers X,Y
# Edit user _cust1_ and assign _custgroup1_ to it
# Edit user _cust2_ and assign _custgroup2_ to it

Now when _cust1_ logs in he/she can only see the two routers assigned to him/her. 

h2. Creating a resource group

The first step is to create a group and select and put resources into the group.

h4. Terminology for Netflow 

Before creating a group some terminology to help you select the correct counter group

- I want to assign routers to users := Select the _FlowGens_ counter group.  FlowGen = Netflow generator represents a router or a netflow capable device
- I want to assign specific router interfaces to users := Select the _FlowIntfs_ counter groups. FlowIntfs = Flow Interfaces represents a netflow capable interface flow interfaces |

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Login as admin and select _Context: default > Admin Tasks > User Resources_ 

<div class='text-center panel panel-info'>
!images/resource_group_list.png!
_Showing all user resource groups with button on top right to create a new resource group_
</div>

You are shown a list of already configured resource groups. 

Select "New Resource Group" from the top right.

h3. Create a resource group 

This step is very simple. Just create an empty resource group with a name and description. The name can be short such as "East Zone Devices" and a longer description. 



<div class='text-center panel panel-info'>
!images/user_resources.png! 
_Create an empty Resource Group with a name, you will add keys later_
</div>

Next you have to add resources to this group.

h3. Add resources to the group

Select the _Add/Edit Resources_ button against the newly created resource group.


<div class='text-center panel panel-info'>
!images/add_edit_resources.png!
_Click to add or edit resources to the new group_
</div>

Give a name for this particular collection of items ; such as _East Zone Routers_ 

Select a counter group from which you will select items. See the Terminology section above. If you want to select Routers then select _FlowGens_ as the counter group.

<div class='text-center panel panel-info'>
!images/resource_group_select1.png!
_Select a counter group. Here we select FlowGens to create a group of routers_
</div>

Next you have to select _Keys_ these are items from the group that have already been discovered and monitored. For example : If you have selected FlowGens (Routers) you will be selecting the routers to add to this group.

<div class='text-center panel panel-info'>
!images/resource_group_select2.png!
_Select routers to add to this group_
</div>


After you select the keys the resouerce group has been created. You can then follow the similar process to add or edit keys at a later time. You can add any number of keys to a counter group and you can add different counter groups in this manner. A common error is to select a counter group twice and trying add keys to both. That will result in an error. The correct way is to create two level counter groups say "East" and "West" and add keys "Routers" to each of them.

p(autohint exclamation-triangle info). 
You can only add a counter group once to a single group. If you want to create two groups of routers say _East_ and _West_ routers then create a new Resource Group as many times as you want


h2. Assigning resource groups to users

This section describes how you can assign a resource group to a user. That restricts that users view to only items in that group.

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Login as admin and select _Context: default > Admin Tasks > User Resources_ 

Then against the user select the _Options > Assign Resources_ 

<div class='text-center panel panel-info'>
!images/user_assign_group.png!
_Assign resource groups to a user_
</div>

Then select the resource groups to assign to this user.

h2. Troubleshooting

h4. Cannot see user groups when I select "Assign Resources"

Ensure that the user is allowed to access the Trisul context. Go to Edit User and ensure that there is atleast one context selected in "Allowed Contexts"

h4. When assigning keys to resource group I am getting: A list of keys already exists for this counter group

You are trying to re-use a counter group for which keys are already assigned. In this screen you can assign keys for different groups - eg Routers, Hosts, Interfaces etc. If you want to select the same counter group, then create a new top level resource group.
