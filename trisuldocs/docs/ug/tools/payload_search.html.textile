h1.  Payload Search 

If you have full packet capture enabled, you can search your network traffic for patterns. Trisul gives you a point and click interface that makes it dead simple and intuitive.

You can search for 
# Text patterns %(label)New% UTF-8 and Unicode also supported
# Binary 
# MD5s
# Select a file

Figure. Search for text, binary, or files within HTTP traffic. 


h3. How this works

p(autohint lightbulb-o success). 
Make sure you have full packet capture and flow tracking enabled in the "trisulConfig.xml":/docs/ref/trisulconfig.html file


Trisul will reassemble and check all TCP streams in both directions for a match. If HTTP compression and chunked encoding are used, they are also factored in. Finally Trisul will show you a list of  flows that match along with a highlighted context  â€“ you can then pull the packets as a PCAP file into "Unsniff Network Analyzer":http://www.google.com/search?q=unsniff for further analysis.


div(info). 
%(label label-default)Note%  For maximum benefit, you need to use _Payload Search_ in conjunction with a network forensic reconstruction tool like Unsniff Network Analyzer. Wireshark can also help in a limited way here.

h2. How to use

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
To access select Tools -> Payload Search

First select a time frame from the top panel.  Then enter the search criteria

h4. Search Criteria

You can enter text, binary, or select a file from your local drive.


table(table table-condensed).
|_.Field|_. Description|
|Search Text| Enter a text string. Can be ASCII, Unicode, UTF-8. |
|Search Binary |Enter hex. White space and newlines are ignored.|
|Search MD5s|Enter a list of content MD5 hashes. One MD5 per line, (whitespaces are ignored)|
|Select File|Upload a file and search for matches|

Press  *Find*, you will be shown a list of flows that match.

h4. Flow list

You are shown a list of matching flows along with the pattern highlighted. This gives you some context about the pattern, so you can decide if that particular match if worth investigating further.

* You can then click on the "Get packets in PCAP format".

You can then open the PCAP file in a deep forensics tool like Unsniff for further analysis.


h3. API Access

Using the "Trisul Remote Protocol":/docs/trp/index.html you can even automate the whole process.
