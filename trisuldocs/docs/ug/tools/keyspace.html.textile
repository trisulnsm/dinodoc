h1. Search Key Space 

%(label label-important)New in R 3.0% 

The Search Key Space tool allows you search for activity for all keys lying within a certain lexicographic key space. The most useful application of this is to search for all activity within arbitrary IP network blocks.

p(autohint thumbs-o-up danger). 
This tool is most used to search for activity within multiple IP blocks of known malicious traffic.

h2. Using the Key Space Search tool

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select Tools -> Search Key Space


# Select a time frame
# Select a counter group 
  * Select Hosts if you are looking for netblock matches
# Enter a list of non-overlapping key spaces

h4. Key space list

The key space is entered as @key-from~key_to@ Note that is a tilde character not a hyphen. Multiple key ranges can be entered one per line.

h4. Keys other than IP addresses

You can enter any arbitrary key. For example you can enter the keyspace @P~Z@ in the country counter group to pull up activity for country codes between PA and ZZ.


h2. Results

# The top 25 unique matches each day are shown separately. 
# If the keys are hosts or ports, you can pull up the flows 
# For all keys you can cut through to the key dashboard to access other tools

%(label)Top 25% matches per day is a reasonable limit for human analysis. If you see a lot of matches you may want to narrow the key space and try again.
