h1. ISP Analytics Dashboard

Several ISPs have deployed Trisul in their networks to gain deep insights into their peering and routing efficiencies.  In addition to the normal metrics, device, and interface level drilldowns made available in Trisul Netflow Analytics , the Trisul ISP configuration adds the following.

# Peering Analytics 
# Prefixes IPv4 and IPv6 
# AS analytics
# Mapping ASN, Prefixes, Geo location to gateway routers and interfaces
# Private Peering analytics with content providers
# Route analytics
# Custom metering of downstream customers usage patterns

Trisul provides a global level dashboard for ISP Analytics that includes several menus with various functionalities.

To install the ISP dashboard apps, Refer "ISP Analytics Dashboard":/docs/ug/isp/ispapps.html#install_trisul_apps

h2. ISP Overview

ISP Overview is a top level dashboard in Trisul ISP Analytics. It provides a overall stats about the Active AS, prefixes, paths, total routers, interfaces and countries.

Also it provides statistical information on the total volume of Upload and Download of AS Traffic in bytes.

h2. Peering Analytics

Peering analytics provides ASN Traffic mapping for routers and interfaces. ISP Peering analytics shows detailed information about the Top Upload and Download AS peers for respective Router and Interface. The traffic flows are further split by upstream vs downstream. 

With the help of this Dashboard, You can view ASN Mappings for Routers and Interfaces. The default shows the Flow-ASN which represents the actual routing table.

*Received from upstream:* How much data is received by the interface (IN) from these upstream AS
*Transmit to upstream:* Data transfer to upstream AS
*Receive from downstream:* Received from downstream AS
*Transmit to downstream:* Data transfer to downstream AS
Typically, the Receive from Upstream and Transmit to Downstream totals will match as will the Transmit to Upstream and Receive from downstream. 

h4. Data columns

The following table explains the data in the columns

|_.Field|_.Description|

The path analytics feature is based on collating ASPath information with a router interface.  The following diagram explains the details.

p(image-with-caption). 
!images/path_anaytics_numbers.png!
Path Analytics Numbers

The picture shows a flow ingress interface xe11 on upstream then egress xe22 on downstream. The destination prefix is 200.10.10.0/24 and the AS PATH for the egress side is 200/300.  The AS 200 is a transit AS. The volume is 1GB. This data is shown in the AS Path analytics as below.

p(image-with-caption). 
!images/interface_vs_ASN.png!
Path Analytics interface vs AS node numbers

*APPLICATION NOTE*: Note that the interface traffic numbers will be exact but the AS numbers will be 2X because both the ingress interface and egress interface flow are collated.  Keep that in mind while interpreting the chart.  It is focused on interface -> AS flows, hence the interface numbers are important.

h2. Sankey Crossdrill

Sankey crossdrill is a Crosskey feature that provides sankey charts by matching a cross-key filter with any metric.

Cross keys allow you to create any mapping from X to Y. For example you can create a Cross Key counter group by merging “Internal Hosts of ISP-Peer” to “Flow-ASN” counter group. This will then track Internal IP to ASN flows.  This dashboard helps you view the Sankey diagram for such counter groups.
