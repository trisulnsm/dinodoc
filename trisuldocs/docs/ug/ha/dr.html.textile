h1. Configuring Primary Backup DR systems

This document describes how you can setup a backup Trisul Network Analytics system as a DR (Disaster Recovery) node. 


p(autohint lightbulb-o). 
Terminology :  In some places , we use DR node to refer to the Backup node, and DC node to refer to the Primary node. DC stands for Data Center.  

h2. Prerequisities

If you are configuring Disaster Recovery for a pre-existing Trisul install, ensure you copy the data over manually using scp first. By default, the sync intially only copies the latest 7 days during intialization. 

h3. Per context DR 

The Primary-Backup configuration needs to be configured on a per-context basis. The instructions on this page applies to the _default_ context. Multi tenant customers with multiple contexts need to configure for each context separately. 

h3. Service names

The systemd service names are 

- trisul-hub-replicator := Run on the PRIMARY (DC) node. Sets up the incremental replication processes from the primary.  For contexts other than the default context this service is called @trisul-hub-replicator-contextname@ 

- trisul-hub-primary-health-check := Runs on the BACKUP (DR) node. Checks the PING reachability of PRIMARY nodes. For contexts other than the default context this service is called @trisul-hub-primary-health-check-contextname@ 

h2. Configuring DR on Primary and Backup sites

h3. Create home directories for the trisul user

On both the Primary and Backup sites , Trisul processes run under the username @trisul.trisul@. This will be used by the replication process to synchonize the data. 

Repeat the following process on both the primary and backup site.

Edit /etc/passwd
Assign a shell to the @trisul@ user as shown below

<pre>
trisul:x:999:999:Trisul Daemon User:/home/trisul:/bin/bash
</pre>

Ensure home directory exists for the trisul user

<pre>
root@ubuntuDR:~# mkhomedir_helper trisul
</pre>

Create a password 

<pre class='language-bash'>
root@Ubuntu:~# passwd trisul
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 
passwd: password updated successfully

</code>
</pre>

h3. Create a SSH key pair for automatic ssh

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Do these for both PRIMARY-BACKUP and BACKUP-PRIMARY directions.


h4. Use ssh-keygen

Login as the trisul user and use @ssh-keygen@ to create a key pair. Press ENTER to skip the passphrase.

<pre class='language-bash'>

su trisul

trisul@Ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/trisul/.ssh/id_rsa): 

skip the passphrase
..
</pre>

h4. Use ssh-copy-id to setup login

Use @ssh-copy-id@ to create an automatic login for the @trisul@ user. THis will be used by rsync to transfer data to the backupsite. 

On Primary  :
<pre class='language-bash'>
ssh-copy-id trisul@backup-ip-address
</pre>

On Backup :   
<pre class='language-bash'>
ssh-copy-id trisul@primary 
</pre>

At this point , both sides should be able to login to each other without a password.

h2. Configure the primary site replication  


On the primary site  run the @install-replication-primary.sh@ script to create the replication service. 

<pre class='language-bash'>

root@Ubuntu:/usr/local/share/trisul-hub# ./install-replication-primary.sh 
Configuring this node as a PRIMARY site in a PRIMARY-BACKUP (DR-DC) configuration

You will be asked a series of questions. Hit ENTER to accept defaults

</pre>

h4. Further customization for PRI-BAK replication

Further customization can be done by editing the @DCDRReplicationSettings.conf@ file shown above.

h2. Configure the backup node health check 

The backup node service performs a health check on pre-defined IP addresses in the primary site. If ALL the IPs are unrechable for a predefinied period of time [default 7 minutes], the service declares the PRIMARY site to be down. Then starts the Trisul Probe Processes on the backup site and the service stops. 

Use install-replication-backup.sh to configure the backup node.

<pre class='language-bash'>

root@ubuntuDR:/usr/local/share/trisul-hub# ./install-replication-backup.sh 
Configuring this node as a BACKUP site in a PRIMARY-BACKUP (DR-DC) configuration

</pre>

h4. Further customization for PRI-BAK replication

Further customization can be done by editing the @DRDCHealthCheck.conf@ file shown above. 


h2. Start services on primary and backup nodes


On the PRIMARY node, the trisul-hub-replicator service pushes the incremental changes continuously to the backup site.

On the PRIMARY node.

<pre class='language-bash'>

systemctl start trisul-hub-replicator

</pre>

On the BACKUP node.

<pre class='language-bash'>

systemctl start trisul-hub-primary-health-check 

</pre>



h3. View log files about the status of the processes 

on primary 
@journalctl -fu trisul-hub-replicator@


on backup
@journalctl -fu trisul-hub-primary-health-check@


h2. Failover 

The Failover process is automatic.

When the PRIMARY site fails, the predefined IP addresess become unreachable from the backup site. The trisul-hub-primary-health-check service on the backup site starts the Trisul processes on the backup site and stops.


- Packet Mode :=  arrange the packets to be sent to the backup system
- Netflow mode := the Netflow streams have to be sent to the backup probe addresses. This can be accomplished by a load balancer or other methods. 



h2. Restoration

The restoration process needs manual intervention. First ensure that the conditions that caused the failure have been corrected. 


The process is :

<ul class="step-text">

<li>

h3. on PRIMARY : Bring up the PRIMARY system

Boot the backup system and ensure it is working.  Login to the system and make ensure :

* able to PING the backup node
* able to SSH into the backup node 


</li>

<li>

h3. on PRIMARY : Stop any running Trisul Processes

Ensure all processes are stopped on the primary system

<pre class='language-bash'>
	trisulctl_hub stop context all 
</pre>

</li>

<li>

h3. on BACKUP : Copy the data to the PRIMARY

Now we need to copy the data from the running backup system onto the primary. This will include all the data that was collected during the downtime of the primary.

p(autohint lightbulb-o). 
This step can take some time as the delta is copied from the BACKUP back to the PRIMARY node. We recommend you use a @screen@ session to run this.

<pre class='language-bash'>

# preferably use a screen session

cd /usr/local/share/trisul-hub

./restore_sync_dr_dc.sh /usr/local/etc/trisul-hub/domain0/hub0/context0/DRDCHealthCheck.conf

</pre>

This will run for a while, copying all the changes back to the DC site.


when the copying finishes you will see a message like the following.

<pre class='language-bash'>

..
sent 37 bytes  received 12 bytes  32.67 bytes/sec
total size is 0  speedup is 0.00
BACKUP WEBTRISUL DB
--- Successfully Finished Sync ---
--- The PRIMARY/DC site data is now ---
--- synchronized with the BACKUP/DR site ---

--- Now you can stop the BACKUP/DR ---
--- and start the PRIMARY/DC site ---
Wed Sep 23 07:07:27 EDT 2020
root@ubuntuDR:/usr/local/share/trisul-hub# 
</pre>

Now you are ready to 
</li>


<li>

h3. on BACKUP  : Stop the probes 

You can manually stop the probes on the backup node. You should not stop the hub nodes however. Run the following command to stop the default context on probe0.

<pre class='language-bash'>
trisulctl_hub stop context default@probe0

</pre>
</li>



<li>

h3. on BACKUP  : Switch back to BACKUP mode

Run this to go back to BACKUP mode. 

<pre class='language-bash'>
systemctl start trisul-hub-primary-health-check
</pre>


</li>

<li>

h3. on PRIMARY : Start the processes

On the primary node start up the processes 

<pre class='language-bash'>

trisulctl_hub 
start context default 
</pre> 

</li>

<li>

h3. on PRIMARY : switch back to PRIMARY mode

This step will put the system back into PRIMARY BACKUP configuration. 

<pre class='language-bash'>

systemctl start trisul-hub-replicator 
</pre> 

</li>
</ul>

This completes the process. 


h2. Viewing status of PRI BAK processes

To view the status of the Replicator and Health Check processes, login as Administrator to either the primary or backup node.  To view the status of the _default_ context, do :


p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select Context: default > Admin Tasks > DC DR Status 


!images/drdcstatus.png!



The following information is shown:

|Mode| Whether the current node is configured as a PRIMARY (DC) or a BACKUP (DR node|
|Replication status| Whether the replication process is _running_, _enabled_ on boot|
|Replication log| Last few lines of the replication log, you can check the timestamps|
|Health check status| On the Backup (DR) node, whether the health check processes are active|
|Health check log| Last few lines of the health check process log |
