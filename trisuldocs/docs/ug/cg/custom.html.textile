h1. Custom counter groups

Trisul ships with 40-50 counter groups. Often users want some special type of metering for their environment. Trisul lets you build your own advanced traffic metering on top of the existing counter groups.  The following types of custom counter groups are supported.

- "<i class='fa fa-filter fa-fw'></i>Filtered Counter Group":#filtered_counter_groups := 
*Meter only a subset of an existing counter group by applying a filter*

Example : A counter group called "Web Hosts" that only counts HTTP and HTTPS traffic. The parent group is "Hosts" and the filter is "Apps 80(http) and 443(https)"
=:

- "<i class='fa fa-cogs fa-fw'></i>Keyset counter group":#keyset_counter_groups := 
*Meter groups of keys rather than individual keys from a host group*

Example : A new counter group called _My apps_ which extends the _Apps_ counter group.  Then specificy groups of ports {4569,5060,3000-4000} as VoIP, {80,443} as Web, {pop3,imaps} as Email. These groups are called keysets.  Similarly you can count groups of IPs as Web Servers, Workstations, VOIP Phones by specifying those groups from the Hosts counter group.

=:
- "<i class='fa fa-th-list fa-fw'></i>Stat based counter group":#traffic_based_counter_groups := 
*Count only keys that whose values match a mathematical value*

Example : A new counter group called _Scanners_, which extends the _Hosts_ counter group but only when the meter _Security Alerts_ is more than 0.
=:
- "<i class='fa fa-bullseye fa-fw'></i>Rule based counter group":#rule_based_counter_groups := 
*Specify arbitrary rules matching your business needs*

Example : A new counter group called _Corporate apps_ which extends the _Apps_ counter group. Then adds these rules  _CCTV Cameras_ - if Port = 80  and subnet = 10.2.2.0/24. You can chain any number of rules to build your custom metering.
=:

- "<i class='fa fa-crosshairs fa-fw'></i>Cross Keys counter group":#cross_key_counter_groups := 
*Cross product of two or three counter groups*

Example : A new counter group called _Traffic Flows_  which is cross product of two counter groups _Internal Hosts X External Hosts_.  The keys in this new counter group with be a combination of both.  Another example is _Geo Flows_ which is a cross product of three counter groups _Internal Hosts X Country X External Hosts_ 
=:

- "<i class='fa fa-map-pin fa-fw'></i>Cardinality counting":#cardinality_counting := 
*Count uniques X of Y*

Cardinality counters are not a new counter group. You can add up to two cardinality meters to any counter group.  For example : You can add to the _Hosts_ counter group a meter for tracking _Unique Apps_  This allows you to track _for every host_  a new metric called _unique apps_

h2. Filtered counter groups 

A cross-product counter group.

Meter a subset of a group that matches a set of keys from another group.

h3.  Uses 

Filtered counter group are invaluable in setting up cross-group counters.

Some examples :

|Users of Youtube | All IPs connecting to known YouTube IPs can be monitored separately |
|HTTP Hosts | Parent = Hosts, Filter = Apps (Keys = http) |
|China Ukraine Hosts | Parent = Hosts, Filter = Country (Keys = cn,ua) |
|Server Apps | Parent = Apps, Filter = Hosts (Key = 10.10.1.18) |


h3. Create new filtered counter groups

|Inverse Key List||


h3. Custom group

For more advanced custom counters you can use the "LUA API":/docs/lua to measure any subset of metrics

------------

h2.  Keyset counter groups

A new counter group that aggregates sets of keys from a host counter group.  This can be used to group IP addresses , port numbers, network intefaces and then count the aggregate. Some examples are shown below


|_.New Keyset Counter Group |_.Host/Parent Group |_.Key sets |
|MyApps |Apps | <ul><li>Ports 80,445,8080 = WEB </li><li>Ports 3000-4000 = VoIP </li><li>Ports 18001,18002,19001 = TRADING</li></ul>  |
|ServerFarm |Hosts |<ul><li>IPs 10.1.17.1,10.1.18.1 = GATEWAYS</li><li>IPs 10.1.17.40 to 50 = MANAGEMENT IPs</li><li>10.1.19.1 to 255 = HR</li></ul> ..build other business groupings |

Fill out these fields

|_.Field Name|_.Description|
|Keyset Counter Group Name|The name of the new counter group. Keep this short.|
|Description|A description of the new counter group|
|Parent Group|The parent counter group from which you will be selecting keys. Select from dropdown|
|Meter only keysets|The default behavior is when keys seen in traffic do not match any groups they will be counted as-is in the new group. If this box is checked, then only those keys that match a group will be metered, others will be discarded.|


Now you have created the counter group. Next you need to group keys together.

p(autohint info-circle info).  
*Restart*
Restart the Probe for changes to take effect.

You can then view the new counter group in _Retro > Retro Counters_

--------------------

h2. Stat based counter groups

A new counter group consisting of items based on an observed meter value.

h3.  Usage 

Creates a subset of a parent group consisting only of items who meet a certain meter criteria.

Examples :

table(noclass).
|Internal hosts only |Subset of hosts |When Hosts meter "Homenet" > 0 |
|Under the radar hosts|Subset of hosts |When Hosts meter "Total" < 2000    (hosts who only xmit or recv < 2K bytes in an interval ) |

------------

h2.   Rule Based counter groups 

A rule based counter group allows you the maximum flexibility to custom-meter your network traffic.

It works like this :

  # Derive from a parent group such as hosts / applications / macs
  # Specify a chain of rules in "Trisul Filter Format":/docs/ref/trisul_filter_format.html
  # The first rule that matches determines the  meter key
  # If no rule matches the key falls through to the parent counter group

h3. An example : Corporate applications 

You are a network admin in an enterprise and wish to meter traffic in terms of your applications.

Here are your requirements.

|_.This kind of traffic |_.Should be metered as |
|Ports 80 on IPs 10.10.17.20, 21, 22 | HR-Attendance |
|Ports 3000-9000 on IP 10.10.18.35 | Trisul-NSM |
|Ports 8000 on IPs 10.10.18.25 - 45 | Security-Cam |
|All traffic to IP 10.10.19.3 | Exchange-Email |
|All others |Use the default application (eg 80 = HTTP, SSH = 22 etc) |

You would specify the rules as follows

Counter Group Name : **ACME APPS** 
Parent Group : **Applications** (guid = {})

|_.No |_.Rule in Trisul Filter Format |_.New Key |
|Rule 1|{4CD742B1-C1CA-4708-BE78-0FCA2EB01A86}=0A.0A.11.14,0A.0A.11.15,0A.0A.11.16&{C51B48D4-7876-479e-B0D9-BD9EFF03CE2E}=Port-80 |HR-Attendance |
|Rule 2|{4CD742B1-C1CA-4708-BE78-0FCA2EB01A86}=0A.0A.12.23&{C51B48D4-7876-479e-B0D9-BD9EFF03CE2E}=Port-3000~Port-8000 |Trisul-NSM |
|Rule 3|{4CD742B1-C1CA-4708-BE78-0FCA2EB01A86}=10.10.18.25~10.10.18.45&{C51B48D4-7876-479e-B0D9-BD9EFF03CE2E}=Port-8000 |Security-Cams |
|Rule 4|{4CD742B1-C1CA-4708-BE78-0FCA2EB01A86}=10.10.19.3|Exchange-Email |
|-|Catch-all  |Uses the same application key as the parent group (applications)  |


h3. Creating a Rule Based Counter Group

Directions to create a new Rule Based Counter Group
p(autohint hand-o-right info). 

Login as Admin -> Select Context and profile -> Under Custom Counters ->  Rule Based

  # Click the option **Create new rule based counter group**

This leads you to a page , whose fields are explained below

|_.FieldName|_.Description|
|Rule Based Counter Group Name| Name of the counter group |
|Description| Words about the goals of the counter group |
|Parent Group|The parent counter group|

After creation , the user is redirected to a page which lists the available rule based counter groups 

Now click the _**Edit Rules**_ option for the counter group , which leads you o another page , whose fields are as follows

|_.FieldName|_.Description|
|Target Key|Name of the target|
|Target Rule|The rule which should be followed|

h4. Specifying a target rule

pre.. {4CD742B1-C1CA-4708-BE78-0FCA2EB01A86}=80.79.32.7A&{C51B48D4-7876-479e-B0D9-BD9EFF03CE2E}=p-0050

p. The above rule tracks the activities of the key @80.79.32.7A@ only for @HTTP@ application

------------

h2.   Cardinality counting

Cardinality counters allow you to measure unique hits for keys within a counter group. For example, we can track how many unique IPs did each country see.  

By default, Trisul ships with the following three cardinality counters enabled. 

|Unique Apps per Host| For each host, track how many unique apps were seen |
|Unique Hosts per Host| For each host, track how many unique hosts (peers) were seen |
|Unique Hosts per App| For each app, track how many unique hosts were seen |

You may add your own cardinality counters to any counter group with the following restriction :

# A maximum of 2 cardinality counters are allowed per counter group.

h3. Creating cardinality counters

Login as Admin -> Select Context and profile -> Under Custom Counters ->  Cardinality

# A list of existing counters is displayed
# Click on _New Cardinality Counter_
# Enter the following three fields

|Host Counter| The counter group whose members you want to attach this counter to |
|Cardinality Counter| The counter group whose uniqueness you want to count |
|Description| Recommended < 16 chars, describing the counter |

h4. Example

If you wanted a cardinality counter to count unique hosts for each country.

# Host Counter Group = @Country@ from dropdown
# Cardinality Counter Group = @Hosts@ from dropdown
# Description = @Unique Hosts@

h3. Using cardinality counters

Once configured, cardinality counters behave just like other counters. They appear as extra counters in the drop down lists, you can draw charts, trend over time, even set threshold crossing alerts on them.

------------------

h2.   Cross Key Counter groups

This lets you monitor a cross product of two or three counter groups. This takes advantage of the fact that Trisul is capable of monitoring millions of unique keys for any counter group.  By crossing the _Applications X Hosts_ counter group you setup a new counter group with  _Unique(hosts) x Unique(apps)_ keys. 

h3. Example 1  :  Two Groups Host flows 

Say you want to see Internal Hosts to External Host traffic flows - you can get this by querying the _Flows database_ using the _Explore Flows_ tool, but this is impractical for large deployments which can have billions of flows.  To solve this we setup a Cross Key Counter group of _Internal Host x External Hosts_

!images/crosskeydoc2.png! 

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
We use the Sankey Crosskey Trisul APP to visualize the flows. Go to Admin > Web Admin > Manage > Apps to install

Using the normal Retro Counters tool you can see the composite keys

!images/crosskeydoc3.png! 

h3. Example 2  :  Three Groups Hosts App flows

You can cross 3 groups as well. Here we setup a new Cross Keys counter group with _Internal Hosts X Applications X External Hosts_

We use the Sankey Crosskey Trisul APP to visualize the flows. Go to Admin > Web Admin > Manage > Apps to install

h3. Creating a Cross Key counter group

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Login as Admin -> Select Context and profile -> Under Custom Counters ->  Crosskeys 

  # Click the option **New Crosskey Counter Group**

This leads you to a form with these five fields.

|_.FieldName|_.Description|
|Counter Group Name| Name of the counter group |
|Description| Description of the group  |
|Parent Group|The parent counter group _G1_ |
|Crosskey Group  | The first cross product counter group group with the parent group _G1 x G2_ |
|Crosskey Group 2 |The optional second cross product _G1 x G2 x G3_ |

After creation , the user is redirected to a page which lists the newly created group.

h4. Enable and Disable crosskeys

The parent counter group and the crosskey group 1 and crosskey group 2 (if used) must be enabled. If any of them are disabled the crosskey counter group will not be created by Trisul. 
 

h3. Viewing 

Once created , the new Cross Key counter group is just like any other group. 

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select Retro -> Retro Tools -> Select counter group 

The cross key counter group is intended for visualizing relationships as Flows. You can use the _Sankey Crosskey_ Trisul APP to visualize the cross key counter group.
