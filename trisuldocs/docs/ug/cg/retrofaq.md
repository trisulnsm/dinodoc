# Retro Q & A

Retro FAQs are complex network analysis like analysing network traffic, flows, and alerts rendered in plain English as a question for easy access.

> Powerful network analysis presented in a “Stack Overflow” style
> **tagged Q & A** format.

If you deal with networks on a daily basis you are bound to perform a
particular analysis repeatedly. You can certainly use one of the [Retro
Tools](retrotools) to accomplish your task but for certain cases that can get repetitive and tiring.

Retro FAQs are like handy answers (dashboards) for your repetitive questions (analysis) where you can just do the analysis in one click from the list of already saved questions.

For example, you may start by selecting a time interval and want to find
out the following as a matter of routine.

- Which internal hosts had the maximum traffic ?  

- What are my busiest hosts and ports ?  

- What IDS alerts were seen over this time period ?  

- Which hosts contacted a particular URL pattern ?  

- What were the most voluminous flows ?

Typically you would select an appropriate Retro Tool, type in the information you wish to seek and submit for each analysis. But with Retro Q & A this whole process becomes painless. With Retro FAQ you can ,

- Any time based analysis can be converted into a Question  

- You can tag related questions together by using #tag  

- Simply select a time interval and click on a question  

- Dynamically adjusting Q & A list will bubble up frequently accessed
  questions to the top
