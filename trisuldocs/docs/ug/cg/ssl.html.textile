h1. SSL/TLS Metering

%(label label-important)New in R 3.0% 

Three new counter groups give you great visibility into the SSL encrypted traffic in your network.

# *TLS Orgs* - Traffic by servers from subject part of the certificate
# *TLS Ciphers* - Traffic by encryption and key exchange algorithm
# *TLS CAs* - Traffic by certificate authority 

p(autohint thumbs-o-up danger). 
Trisul detects usage of SSL/TLS using port independent heuristics.
Trisul handles SSL/TLS session resume.





h2. TLS Orgs

Meter traffic by the entity in the Subject Common Name in the X.509 Certificate. This counter group tells you how much of your SSL traffic is Google, Twitter, Dropbox, etc. Visibiliy you cannot have otherwise. 


p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select Retro -> Retro Counters -> Choose TLS Orgs from the dropdown list

p(image-with-caption).

Meter 0 (Total Traffic) = Bytes per org, Meter 1 (Hits) = Number of SSL/TLS flows 


You can also generate long term usage reports with several charts like the pie chart shown below  using Retro Tools.

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select Retro -> Retro Tools  -> Select Counter Group Toppers -> Select TLS Orgs

h2. TLS Ciphers

Meters traffic by the "cipher suite" used by SSL/TLS connections. The cipher suite is a combination of the encryption and the key-exchange algorithm used.  


p(image-with-caption). 
!images/sslcg2.png!
Meter 0 (Total Traffic) = Bytes per suite, Meter 1 (Hits) = SSL/TLS flows per suite


h2. TLS Certificate authorities 

Tracks the certificate chains of SSL/TLS connections. It takes the Issuer Common Name of each certificate in the chain and meters it in the following manner.

# Issuer CN for last cert in chain -> Metered as Root CA
# Issuer CN for others -> Metered as Intermediate CA 

h4. Usage tip

This is optimized for long term queries, you can select a week or a month as look at any suspicious root or intermediate CAs.

p(image-with-caption). 
!images/sslcg1.png!
Meter 0 (Inter CA) = flows as intermediate CA, Meter 1 (Hits) = flows as root CA


h2. Usage tips

# "SSL Cert resources":/docs/ug/resources/sslcerts.html allow you to search for hashes in bulk
# "SSL Cert FTS":/docs/ug/resources/ftsssl.html allow you to search for arbitrary strings in certificates
