## Investigate activity of a specific IP

Enter an IP address or a host name to view detailed activity of that
host.

The analysis includes

1. Activity charts including peers, upload, download
2. Top applications for this host
3. Conversations with other hosts
4. Security attacks targeted at host
5. Blacklisted activity (malware/botnet) if any
6. Individual flows

Trisul will then run the [Investigate IP](/docs/ug/tools/investigate_ip_activity.html) analysis tool for the
selected items and time interval.

## Counter Group toppers

View the toppers for a counter group and meter.

For example : You can select counter group *Hosts* and meter
*Connections* to view hosts with most connections in the selected
interval.

The information is presented in lists, charts, and a trend chart.

## Show traffic chart for an item

View usage charts for a particular item for selected time interval.

For example : You can just type **smtp** in the box and view all
statistics for the requested application in charts and tables. You can
then save them as PDF if you wish.

## Security Alerts retro

Slice and dice IDS events from different angles in selected time
interval.

The available selections in the drop down list *View IDS Alerts By* are:

> From any of the alert analysis you have drilldown options to flows and
> raw packets

## Investigate users of an application

Complete break up of behavior of an application.

The analysis includes

1. IP conversation matrix for this app
2. Tops IPs transmitting and receiving app
3. Peers
4. Top individual flows involving this app

The analysis will take you to the [Explore](/docs/ug/tools/explore_flows.html) tool with the selected
items and time interval.

## Flow trackers

Flow trackers are used to monitor and store top flows matching specific
criteria.

Some of the built in trackers are :

> You can create your own [flow trackers](/docs/ug/flow/tracker.html) They will show up in this dropdown list

|                 |                                                                                                         |

| Local Traffic   | Top flows internal to your Home network                                                                 |
| Suspicious      | Flows that fired a blacklist based even, either by IP, requesting a domain name, or by requesting a URL |
| FilterFailed    | Flows that donâ€™t use any of the well known ports                                                        |

## Pull Packets

Pull up a sample of raw packets for the selected time interval and
additional criteria.

:::note

There are some caps on this feature to prevent accidental misuse.

1. By default only 5MB of raw data is retrieved
2. By default only 1800s (30minutes) of interval can be analyzed

If you wish to change these settings, go to [App Settings](/docs/ug/webadmin/web_options.html) and change the *Deep
Packet Inspection Limit* and *Deep Packet Inspection Content Limit*.
Please be aware that in busy network analyzing packets can take time to
complete.

**Using the tool**

You have two ways to use this tool to pull up raw packets.

1. **Packets for an item** -\> Select a counter group and key.  
   Counter group = `Country` and key = `JA` will get packets from
   Japan.  
   Counter group = `Apps` and key = `smtp` will get email packets.
2. **Packets matching expression** -\> [Trisul Filter
   Format](/docs/ref/trisul_filter_format.html) is a flexible way of constructing filters. You can enter an expression to run more sophisticated packet queries.  
   Enter the string `{C51B48D4-7876-479E-B0D9-BD9EFF03CE2E}=p-0050,p-0051,p-0052,p-0053` to retrieve packets for ports 80,81,82, and 83.

Upon running the tool, your browser will automatically download a PCAP
file containing the requested packets.

## Long term traffic charts

Draw long term charts designed to aid time of day based comparisons.

You have to select an item and a set of stats to chart for that item.
The result will be a chart showing most recent 7 days of data arranged
by day.

![](images/retrotools/analyze_key.png)

This tool will take you to the [Long term traffic trends](/docs/ug/tools/analyze_item.html) tool with the start time and other selections automatically filled in.
