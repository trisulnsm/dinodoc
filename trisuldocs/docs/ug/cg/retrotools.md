## Network FAQ

Network FAQ is a tool that allows you to save and easily access frequently performed network analyses. You can access the dashboards in a click to monitor, understand your network traffic, hosts, and alerts.

To view Network FAQ,

:::note navigation

Go to Retro-> Retro tools-> Network FAQ

:::

This is an example of the Network FAQ module.

Refer [Retro Q&A](/docs/ug/cg/retrofaq) for more details.

## Counter Group Toppers

Counter Group Toppers views the top entities (e.g., hosts, ports, protocols) that exhibit the highest values for a specific network traffic metric or counter.

To view Counter Group Toppers,

:::note navigation

Go to Retro-> Retro tools-> Counter Group Toppers

:::

For example : You can select counter group *Hosts* and meter
*Connections* to view hosts with most connections in the selected
interval.

The information is presented as dashboards in lists, charts, and a trend chart.

## Investigate IP Activity

Enter an IP address or a host name to monitor and analyze network traffic to understand the behavior and patterns of that specific IP address.

To investigate an IP activity,

:::note navigation

Go to Retro-> Retro tools-> Investigate IP activity

:::

![](images/investigateipretro.png)

*Figure: Investigate IP Activity Retro Tool*

The analysis includes

1. Activity charts including total bandwidth, peers, upload, download, apps etc
2. Top 10 matching individual flows of total 10
3. Peers and applications and Conversations with other hosts
4. Security attacks targeted at host. Malware and alert activity detected.

Trisul will then run the Investigate IP analysis tool for the selected items and time interval.

## Investigate Users of an Application

Complete break up of behavior of an application.

To investigate any application,

:::note navigation

Go to Retro-> Retro tools-> Investigate Application

:::

Enter an port value say p-0587 and you will  get the detailed activity including the flows matching the time interval, activity details like top peers, top apps, flow taggers, interfaces, etc.

To view Explore Flows tool,

:::note navigation

Go to Retro-> Retro tools-> Explore Flows

:::

![](images/exploreflowsretro.png)

*Figure: Explore Flows Retro Tool*

> Click on the little question mark hint near the search expression toolbar to  Enter an expression like **ip=19.168.211.10** or ip=gmail.com or ip=fe80::fe08:7ad1 or port=smtp or port=p-0050 or port=80 and drill down into specific flows to investigate their traffic behavior.

## Show Traffic Chart for an Item

With Show traffic charts, you can view usage charts for a particular item for selected time interval.

To view Traffic charts,

:::note navigation

Go to Retro-> Retro tools-> Traffic Charts

:::

For example : You can just type **smtp** in the box and view all
statistics for the requested application in charts and tables. You can
then save them as PDF if you wish.

## Pull Packets

Pull up a sample of raw packets for the selected time interval and
additional criteria.

To view Pull Packets,

:::note navigation

Go to Retro-> Retro tools-> Pull Packets
:::

![](images/pullpacketsretro.png)

*Figure: Pull Packets Retro Tool*

There are some caps on this feature to prevent accidental misuse.

1. By default only 5MB of raw data is retrieved
2. By default only 1800s (30minutes) of interval can be analyzed

If you wish to change these settings, go to [App Settings](/docs/ag/webadmin/web_options) and change the *Deep
Packet Inspection Limit* and *Deep Packet Inspection Content Limit*.
Please be aware that in busy network analyzing packets can take time to
complete.

**Using the tool**

You have two ways to use this tool to pull up raw packets.

1. **Packets for an item** -> Select a counter group and key.  
   Counter group = `Country` and key = `JA` will get packets from
   Japan.  
   Counter group = `Apps` and key = `smtp` will get email packets.
2. **Packets matching expression** -> [Trisul Filter
   Format](/docs/ref/trisul_filter_format) is a flexible way of constructing filters. You can enter an expression to run more sophisticated packet queries.  
   Enter the string `{C51B48D4-7876-479E-B0D9-BD9EFF03CE2E}=p-0050,p-0051,p-0052,p-0053` to retrieve packets for ports 80,81,82, and 83.
3. **Handy Shortcuts**-> Clicking on Handy Shortcuts you get an option to "Get all packets" to download all the packets

Upon running the tool, your browser will automatically download a PCAP
file containing the requested packets.

## View Edges

With Trisul's streaming analytics, hundreds of metrics are captured and the Edges help discover how the metrics are related to each other beyond the flow connection. 

To view Edges,
