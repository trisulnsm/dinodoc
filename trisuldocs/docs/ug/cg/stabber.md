# Real Time Stabbers

Real time stabbers allow you to monitor various types of network
activity within a 5 second delay.

> A **Real Time Stabber** is a tool that allows you to get instant
> visibility into selected network traffic. The inspiration comes from
> the thermometer you **stab** into a piece of cake in the oven to check
> its temperature.
