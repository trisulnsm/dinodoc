h1.  Real Time Stabbers

Real time stabbers allow you to monitor various types of network activity within a 5 second delay.

bq. A *Real Time Stabber* is a tool that allows you to get instant visibility into selected network traffic. The inspiration comes from the thermometer you *stab* into a piece of cake in the oven to check its temperature.

=: 
- "Flow Stabber":#flow_stabber :=
