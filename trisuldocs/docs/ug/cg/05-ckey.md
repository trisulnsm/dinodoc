# Custom Key Monitors

Custom Key Monitors allow you to monitor a set of items in real time,
irrespective of whether they show up in the toppers list or not. You can
think of them as subset of a counter group that is “special” to you. For
example, the IP (Hosts counter group) 192.168.14.16 is our internal
build server, so we want to monitor it separately, generate reports for
it separately, even though we may have thousands of other hosts.

You would want to use custom key monitors if :  

- If you want to keep an eye on a set of servers  

- You want to track certain VSAT (Satellite links)  

- You want near real time views  

- You want to generate custom reports of just these items
