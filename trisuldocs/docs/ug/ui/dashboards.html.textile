h2. Current Hosts

A live view of current host activity.  Internal hosts are shown on the left side and the external hosts on the right side.  Hosts are automatically classified as internal or external based on the "Home Networks":/docs/ug/webadmin/home_networks.html.  Under the screenshot you can find a description of each module.

|Recent Attackers|A list of top hosts from which IDS alerts have originated as attacks. |
|Recent Victim Host|A list of hosts which IDS alerts indicate have been victims of attacks. Note that this does not mean they were breached, but only that the hosts were being attacked. |

|TCP Targets|Top TCP targets|




h2. Sessions

Shows most significant currently active IP flows. This is based on "Flow Trackers":/docs/ug/tools/flow_tracker.html a special type of streaming analytics snapshot used in Trisul. The following classes of flows are displayed.


|_. Module|_. Description|
|Top Flows by Volume| Top N flows transferring most number of bytes|
|Top OUT flows |Top N flows uploading data out of your home network|
|Top Long Lived Flows|Top N long duration flows. This could indicate remote desktops, SSH logins, that are not transferring much data but are nevertheless suspects for exfiltration. |
|Top IN flows|Downloading data into your home network |
|Top TCP Upload flows|Top TCP Flows uploading data out your home network. The difference between this and the _Top UPLOAD Flows_ is this group measure actual Payload transferred via TCP , the first one includes all payloads+ retransmissons+TCP/IP headers.  |
|Top DOWNLOAD  flows|Top TCP Flows downloading data into your home network. Payload based  |

Flows tracked include TCP/UDP/GRE/IPSEC/ and all flows at IP Layer.

h2. ASN Monitoring

Monitor traffic by ASN. Helps you with planning peering relationships with Autonomous Systems at Gateway points. 

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select _Retro Counters_ select a Time Interval and then select "AS Number" from the dropdown 


h3. Monitor Total volume per AS 


p(image-with-caption). 
!images/dashboards/asnumbers.png!
Showing Total  Traffic to and From AS 


h3. Monitor Time series traffic profile per AS 

p(image-with-caption). 
!images/dashboards/asn2.png!
Showing Timeseries Traffic profiles per Autonomous System at Gateways

The Autonomous System traffic is monitored using two mechanisms 

- From packets := using a built in database of AS IP Prefixes
- From netflow := from border routers peering AS BGP information



---


h2. Country Location based Traffic monitoring

Monitor traffic uploaded and download on a per-Country basis. The Country Code can also be added to every single flow using "Automatic Flow Taggers":/docs/ug/flow/tagger.html   The included statistics are Top-K,  Time Series Traffic Profile for planning and trending, and Bottom-K for outlier and security applications. You can even map the traffic down to the City/County level. 


h3. Traffic upload and download 

Keep track of which countries give most traffic , flows, Top-N, Bottom-N and Time series trending supported.

h4. Geo map

You can put in your Google API key to plot the top traffic sources and destinations on a Geographical map as well. To enter your Google API 

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
This feature requires you to "enter a valid Google API KEY":/docs/ug/webadmin/web_options.html#ui via _Customize -> App Settings -> UI_

h2. Real Time Alerts

A real time visualization of IDS alert activity.  Note this is true realtime using WebSockets PUSH.  The dashboard is described in detail in "IDS Alert Stabber":/docs/ug/alerts/ids_stabber.html 

Real Time Stabbers are a Trisul feature that allow the Trisul Probe network to directly push events on to the browser. 


|_. Module|_. Description|
|Options Toolbar| Allows you to select options for Pivot (which field to pivot), Timeframe, and Scaling|
|Bubbles by Signature|An interactive visualization showing alert activity over time|
|Alerts as they come in|Recently pushed raw alerts|
|Aggregated alerts|Alerts types aggregated by time |



h2. Real Time Traffic

A real time 1-second view of network traffic. This dashboard uses the underlying Real Time Stabbers framework. The stats are pushed directly to the browser from the Probe network, so the data is typically 1-2 seconds real time. 

p(image-with-caption). 
!images/dashboards/rt_traffic.png!
Watch a live situation of network traffic 

|_. Module|_. Description|
|IN/OUT bandwidth| Real time In vs Out network bandwidth usage. In/Out are relative to the _Home Network_ you have configured.	|
|Total Bandwidth|Total bandwidth seen|
|Top Internal Hosts|Currently active Internal Hosts|
|Top Applications|Currently active top applications |

h3. Real time stabbers

You can watch any metric , Top-K, or Flows in real time using the "Real Time Stabbers (read more)":/docs/ug/cg/stabber.html

h2. Active Keys Monitor

A live view of the number of active keys in all counter groups.  The purpose of this dashboard is to give you a one-page idea of the _cardinality_ of your network from various different angles.  For example : Do you know how many external hosts you have active over time? 

For each counter group the following information is displayed	

|_. Module|_. Description|
|Name| Counter group name. Clicking will take you to the "Long Term Charts" page showing the active keys|
|Sparkline|Number of active unique keys over the past 24 hrs . Use this to detect any abnormalities|
|Active Keys|Total number of keys currently active|
|New Keys|New Keys seen in last time interval|
|Water marks|Hi and Lo Water marks for the counter group|




h2. System Performance 

A very important dashboard to help you keep tabs of your  Trisul Probe performance. The metrics shown here are not related to the network but to the Trisul Probes themselves.


|_. Module|_. Description|
|Global Flush Time| How much time it took for a streaming snapshot interval to finish. You may see "GlobalFlush-1" "GlobalFlush-0" etc. These represent the number of parallel streaming pipelines we have.	|
|Memory Usage|Memory used by the system and the memory used by Trisul Probe instance|
|Packets Dropped|Packets dropped by each front-end parallel streaming pipeline. For example : Each AF_PACKET fanout would instantiate a separate parallel streaming engine. The total packets dropped is a sum of all the items shown |
|Packets processed|Number of packets processed by each streaming frontend pipeline |
|Packets drop percent|Represents the total dropped packets/total packets processed |
|Disk I/O|Read and Write I/O rates. When you have the Packet Ring enabled this can be useful measure disk load |
|Disk Bandwidth|A very useful statistic. Tells you at how much Mbps is the data throughput to disk. In a steady state with full packets enabled, a 100Mbps traffic monitor would also result in a 100Mbps disk bandwidth|


h2. More dashboards

There are dozens of other dashboards like this and you can create your own. Clicking on the "Show All" menu item brings up a list of all dashboards. You can check them out one by one. 

The intent of this page is to give you an idea of the default dashboards we have pinned to the menu out of the box.
