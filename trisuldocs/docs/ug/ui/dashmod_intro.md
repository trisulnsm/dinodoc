# Introduction to Dashboards and Modules

A *Dashboard* is a visual representation of key performance indicators and metricsÂ that are used to measure the performance of a network traffic. Using Dashboards you can easily monitor and and analyze data in real- time. A Trisul *Dashboard* contains *modules* at various positions.

Dashboards are,

**Visual** You can use charts, graphs, tables and other visual elements to display data

**Interactive** You can interact with dashboards to drilldown into details, filter data, and explore different scenarios

**Real-Time** Dashboards display up to date data reflecting the current status of the network

**Customizable** You can play around with dashboards that can be personalized/customized to specific needs of different users

## Key Rules About *Modules* and *Dashboards*

1. A dashboard may contain several modules.  

2. A module may appear in any number of dashboards.  

3. A module may even appear multiple times in the same dashboard.  

4. A change in a module property will propagate to all the dashboards
   which use the module.  

5. If there are no modules in a particular position that position is not
   rendered at all as trisul modules auto adjust for width.

*Modules* are like widgets or tiles in a *dashboard* that are individual components displaying  specific information, metrics, or data visualizations. They are the building blocks of a *dashboard* and can be customized to show various types of content. 

Modules in a dashboard can be of various types including,

**Charts and Graphs** Display data visualizations, such as line charts, bar charts, or pie charts.

**Tables and Lists** Show tabular data, such as lists and tables.

**KPIs** Display important metrics, such as numbers, percentages, or gauges.

**Maps and GeoSpatial**Show geographic data, such as maps and location-based information.

**Texts and Labels** Display static or dynamic text, such as titles, descriptions, or notifications.

**Gauges and Meters** Display progress or measurement indicators, as in speedometers or thermometers.

**Real-Time Traffic Feeds** Real-time traffic updates, including congestion, incidents, and threats.

**Custom Modules** Can be developed to meet specific needs, such as integrating with external services.

## An Example - Current Hosts

The first screen you will see when you login as user is the Current Hosts
overview dashboard

![thumbnail_zoom](images/host_dashboard.png "thumbnail_zoom")  
*Figure: Host Dashboard*

You can see that this dashboard is nothing but four modules laid out in
two columns. Trisul has well defined column positions into which you can
place modules. See [Module Positions](/docs/ug/ui/modules#add-modules-to-a-newexisting-dashboard)

Lets take a closer look at the dashboard shown above.

| Top 2 position column 1                   | Top 2 position column 2                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Module : In vs out traffic (past 6 hours) | Module : Active TCP connections (past 6 hours) |
| Module : Top Internal Hosts (current)     | Module : Top External Hosts (current)          |

## View a Dashboard/All Dashboards

There are more than one way to navigate to view all dashboards

**Method 1:**

:::info navigation

From the Menu, Go to *Dashboards* &rarr;  *Show all*

This also shows the list of available dashboards.

To **open a particular dashboard**, from the list of dashboards, click on the dashboard you would like to view.

## View a Module/All Modules

To view all modules,

:::note path

From the Menu, Go to Customize-> Show all-> Modules

:::

*Figure: Showing All Modules*

This will show a list of all available modules.

To **view one particular module** from the list, check on the name of the dashboard that contains the module and navigate to that dashboard to select the module.

## Toolbars

### Dashboard Toolbars

You can control dashboard layout and contents by using the toolbars.

Dashboard toolbars can be accessed from the right side corner of each
dashboard window.

With Dashboard Toolbar you can

**Customize** Allows you to personalize the dashboard to your preferences, such as rearranging modules, adding or removing modules, and changing the layout.

**Toggle Labels** Toggles the display of labels for each module on the dashboard, providing a more detailed information.

**Set as Default Dashboard** Saves the current dashboard configuration as your default view, so every time you log in, this customized dashboard will be displayed.

**Expand all Modules** Opens up all collapsed modules on the dashboard, allowing you to see all the information at once.

**Collapse all modules** Collapses all expanded modules on the dashboard, providing a more compact view and reducing clutter.

**Download as PDF** You can exports the current dashboard view as a PDF file, and save, or share the data for reports.

### Module Toolbars

Module toolbar is the three dots on the top right corner of the [module](/docs/ug/ui/dashmod_intro#view-a-moduleall-modules). By clicking on the module toolbar you get a list of actions that can be done on the modules.
