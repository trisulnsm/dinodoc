h1. Key dashboard

The _Key Dashboard_ is a special type of dashboard used to view and drilldown from "Keys". In Trisul terminology a Key is an item within a counter group.  Clicking on any key will take you to the Key Dashboard from there you can pivot to a number of different analysis paths.


A quick recap of the hierarchy and terminology first:

* *Counter Group* - A type or entity being measured. For example (Hosts)
** *Key* - A specific item being measured within the Counter group. For example (google.com)
*** *Meter* - A metric within the key. For example ( Number of connections )

h3. How to access the key dashboard

There are two ways to get to the key dashboard

h4. 1. By clicking 

%(hint command)Click on any item in any page to open the key dashboard for that item%

Some examples :

|!images/keydashaccess1.png!|All hosts are linked to their respective key dashboards|
|!images/keydashaccess2.png!|Hosts/Ports for these malware alerts are linked|

Note that you can also click on PIE and BUBBLE chart items.


h4. 2. By searching

%(hint command)Type in a search and click on search results%

The search method is very useful if you want to see details of something that is not visible on any of the screens shown by Trisul. For example : You want to search for a host @mail.trisul.org@ but it isnt showing up on any lists for you to click on.


h3. Using the key dashboard

The default key dashboard has the following modules. Here is a brief description of each of these modules. They are mostly self explanatory.
