# Default dashboards

Trisul ships with a bunch of default dashboards which you will be seeing
as soon as you first log in. This page describes each of them.

## Current Hosts

A live view of current host activity. Internal hosts are shown on the
left side and the external hosts on the right side. Hosts are
automatically classified as internal or external based on the [Home
Networks](/docs/ug/webadmin/home_networks). Under the screenshot you can find a description of each module.

*Current active internal and external hosts dashboard*

The Hosts dashboard consists of the following modules

## ASN Monitoring

Monitor traffic by ASN. Helps you with planning peering relationships
with Autonomous Systems at Gateway points.

:::note navigation

Select *Retro Counters* select a Time Interval and then select âAS
Numberâ from the dropdown

:::

### Monitor Total volume per AS

![](images/dashboards/asn.png)  
*Showing Total Traffic to and From AS*

### Monitor Time series traffic profile per AS

![](images/dashboards/asn-2.png)  
*Showing Timeseries Traffic profiles per Autonomous System at Gateways*

The Autonomous System traffic is monitored using two mechanisms

***From packets***  
using a built in database of AS IP Prefixes

***From netflow***  
from border routers peering AS BGP information

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Country Location based Traffic monitoring

Monitor traffic uploaded and download on a per-Country basis. The
Country Code can also be added to every single flow using [Automatic
Flow Taggers](/docs/ug/flow/tagger) The included statistics are Top-K, Time Series Traffic Profile for planning and trending, and Bottom-K for outlier and security applications. You can even map the traffic down to the City/County level.

### Traffic upload and download

Keep track of which countries give most traffic , flows, Top-N, Bottom-N
and Time series trending supported.

*Showing Top-N country traffic by upload and download*

## Real Time Alerts

A real time visualization of IDS alert activity. Note this is true
realtime using WebSockets PUSH. The dashboard is described in detail in
[IDS Alert Stabber](/docs/ug/alerts/ids_stabber)

Real Time Stabbers are a Trisul feature that allow the Trisul Probe
network to directly push events on to the browser.

| Module                 | Description                                                                           |

## Real Time Traffic

A real time 1-second view of network traffic. This dashboard uses the
underlying Real Time Stabbers framework. The stats are pushed directly
to the browser from the Probe network, so the data is typically 1-2
seconds real time.

### Real time stabbers

You can watch any metric , Top-K, or Flows in real time using the [Real
Time Stabbers (read more)](/docs/ug/cg/stabber)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Active Keys Monitor

A live view of the number of active keys in all counter groups. The
purpose of this dashboard is to give you a one-page idea of the
*cardinality* of your network from various different angles. For example: Do you know how many external hosts you have active over time?

For each counter group the following information is displayed

| Module      | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name        | Counter group name. Clicking will take you to the âLong Term Chartsâ page showing the active keys |
| Sparkline   | Number of active unique keys over the past 24 hrs . Use this to detect any abnormalities          |
| Active Keys | Total number of keys currently active                                                             |
| New Keys    | New Keys seen in last time interval                                                               |
| Water marks | Hi and Lo Water marks for the counter group                                                       |

## System Performance

A very important dashboard to help you keep tabs of your Trisul Probe
performance. The metrics shown here are not related to the network but
to the Trisul Probes themselves.

| Module               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global Flush Time    | How much time it took for a streaming snapshot interval to finish. You may see âGlobalFlush-1â âGlobalFlush-0â etc. These represent the number of parallel streaming pipelines we have.                              |
| Memory Usage         | Memory used by the system and the memory used by Trisul Probe instance                                                                                                                                               |
| Packets Dropped      | Packets dropped by each front-end parallel streaming pipeline. For example : Each AF_PACKET fanout would instantiate a separate parallel streaming engine. The total packets dropped is a sum of all the items shown |
| Packets processed    | Number of packets processed by each streaming frontend pipeline                                                                                                                                                      |
| Packets drop percent | Represents the total dropped packets/total packets processed                                                                                                                                                         |
| Disk I/O             | Read and Write I/O rates. When you have the Packet Ring enabled this can be useful measure disk load                                                                                                                 |
| Disk Bandwidth       | A very useful statistic. Tells you at how much Mbps is the data throughput to disk. In a steady state with full packets enabled, a 100Mbps traffic monitor would also result in a 100Mbps disk bandwidth             |

## More dashboards

There are dozens of other dashboards like this and you can create your
own. Clicking on the âShow Allâ menu item brings up a list of all
dashboards. You can check them out one by one.

The intent of this page is to give you an idea of the default dashboards
we have pinned to the menu out of the box.
