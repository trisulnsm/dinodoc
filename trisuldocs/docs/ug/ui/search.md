# Using search

You can use the *Search* tool to find items of interest.

> You can :

- Search by an IP address, Port number, etc.
- Search by user labels like host names, alert signature names, etc.
- Directly type in a trisul key like p-0050

> If you wish to search for resources like HTTP URLs and DNS
> names, you will be redirected to their search forms which are more
> flexible. See [URL Resources](/docs/ug/resources/url.html) and [DNS Resources](/docs/ug/resources/dns.html)
