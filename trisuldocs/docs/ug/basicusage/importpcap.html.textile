h1. Importing a PCAP file 

How to create a new context by importing PCAP (packet capture) dumps.


h2. trisulctl_probe importpcap 

Logon to the Trisul-Probe node where you have the PCAP dumps and run the following command.

<pre class='language-bash'>

trisulctl_probe importpcap /home/trisul/dumps/MassivePacket.pcap context=mass1
</pre>

This command does the following
* if a context called _mass1_ does not exist; creates it
* if _mass1_ exists, it cleans it (ask you permission first)
* runs the PCAP through trisulctl_probe and into the context _mass1_
* to view results ; logon to Web Trisul and in the login screen select _mass1_
