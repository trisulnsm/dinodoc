      <h6> Quickly see packet contents without pulling out the pcap</h6>
      <div>
        <p>
          In a majority of situations, you can identify what a particular flow is about by examining the initial packets of the flow. Previously you had to click on "Pull Packets" next to a flow to pull out a PCAP into an application like Unsniff or Wireshark. Now you can click on "Show Headers" along side each flow.

        <p>
          This is extremely useful for quick analysis of flow packets without leaving Trisul.  If you want the entire flow, you can always click on "Download" to get it right now, or "Add to briefcase" to add the PCAP to the briefcase and download later as a single ZIP files.
