# Packet Capture Basics

The Trisul raw packet engine is designed towards these goals :

1. **Scaling** — The amount of data is only limited by the disk resources at your disposal

2. **Multi disk** — Supports multiple disks to optimize $/byte

3. **Flexibility** — Allows you to specify policies to cut down storage requirements

4. **Security** — Encrypts the raw packet storage

**Free License**  
Note that the [free license](https://trisul.org/free) only allows you to store a maximum of 10GB per Probe. You can use rules to cut down the traffic, such as not storing encrypted traffic.
