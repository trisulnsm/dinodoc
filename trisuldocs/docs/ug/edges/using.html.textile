h1. Working with Edges

The entry point into exploring the streaming graph database of Trisul is to select two items

# a  _root vertex_ from where you can enter the graph. 
# a time window 

All exploration is done in a tool called the "Edge Graph Explorer".

h2. Enable Feature

New installations of Trisul will already have _Edges_ enabled. If you are upgrading an older install, ensure that you add the following line in "trisulProbeConfig.xml":/docs/ref/trisulconfig.html#edges

<pre  class='language-xml'>
<code>
<Edges>
    <Enable>True</Enable>
</Edges>
</code>
</pre>

h2. View Edge Graph

In a number of places in Trisul, you will see a list of keys within a counter group.

*  Select the "View Edge Graph" menu to bring up the Graph Explorer.
*  If you use "Retro Analysis" the time period is automatically set to the focus time window.

h2. Tools > Edge Graph

To set an arbitrary node as the "root vertex"

p(autohint hand-o-right info). 
Select Tools -> Edge Graph
  

In the form that is shown there are four fields

| Group | Select a Counter or Alert group from the drop down list|
| Key | Enter a key within the counter group|
| From, To | Time Window |


h2. Graph Explorer

The graph explorer is a simple point and click tool that allows you to expand and explore the graph network.


When you first open the Graph Explorer
* The immediate adjacent nodes are shown
* Each vertex group is of a different color
* Hover mouse over a node for more drilldown options
* Click on a node to open  _its_ 1 level adjacent neighbors


The tool options are :

| View Label | Shows labels or readable keys. For example, how hostnames or IP addresses for the _Hosts_ counter group|
| Treemap view | Use a Tree map to show the graph. This is a cleaner option in some cases |
| Flow grap view | Use a force directed graph to display |




p(autohint lightbulb-o info).  
*TIP* If the force graph is too messy, select a highly connected node, drag it a empty area and shake it a bit. The graph settles into a better layout.
