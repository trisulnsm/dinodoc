h1.  URL Filter Plugin 



URL Blacklisting is a common way to enforce enterprise web surfing policy. A blacklist contains a number of well known URLs categorized into groups like 'video'/'internet radio'/'news'/'prOn'/'games' etc. They are then automatically blocked by web proxies or firewalls.




h2.  Location 

In a file called @PI-21AA9300-A03A-45C9-94D6-0B62BD8313F6.xml@ in  _/usr/local/etc/trisul-probe/domainX/probeX/contextX_  Use the *cfgedit* tool.

h3. What does the URLFilter plugin provide

- New URLCategory counter group :=
Allows you to meter traffic by category. This allows you to do things like "Chart the Radio and News traffic for yesterday" =: 
- Correlated with flows and packets :=
Allows you to pull up sessions and packets for any suspicious category =: 

The following screenshot shows :
# Long term charts of various categories
# Total volume of traffic in each category
# PIE chart to give you a rough idea

We got the above screenshot by
# Going to Retro Analysis
# Selecting 11 hours of traffic 
# Applying the "Counter Group Activity":/docs/ug/cg/retrotools.html#counter_group_activity tool for the URLCategory group

h2.  Database 

The plugin can accept any blacklist in the following format.

<pre>
   blacklist
   |__ gambling
       |__domains (file containing a single blacklisted url per line)
</pre>

The only provider of blacklists in this format is Shallalist from "Shalla Secure Services"://www.shallalist.de/categories.html.

You need to independently procure this list from them.

h3.  Commercial - Recommended 

Shall Secure Services offers a daily updated version of this list for a fee. 

div(info). 
Please contact the list vendor "Shallalist":http://www.shallalist.de  *directly* for a commercial license. We highly recommend you get that to enhance the accuracy of the plugin. 

h3.  Private use 

The list from Shalla Secure Services is free if you intend to use it for private purposes. Once again, check with the list vendor directly if you have any questions. 

h2.  Auto updating the database 

The accuracy and utility of this classification depends on the database that powers it.

The //urlfilter// plugin will automatically download and apply the latest database at a set schedule. You can control when and how frequently the database is updated.


h3.  Controlling the auto update process 

Once the plugin is installed, the file _/usr/local/share/trisul/plugins/UrlFilter.xml_ contains the parameters for automatic updates. The parameters you want to edit are

|_.Run At|At what time do you want to run the download + update |
|_.Frequency|How frequent do you want to run the auto update in seconds ? Note 86400 seconds = 1 day |

h3.  Updating manually 

Whether you purchase the commercial license from http://www.shallalist.de/ or get the personal license, you will end up with a single file called @shallalist.tar.gz@

You need to process this file into a compact database that Trisul understands using a tool called _mkurlfdb_

First put the blacklist in a temporary area (say /tmp)
<pre>
cd /tmp
gunzip shallalist.tar.gz
cd /usr/local/lib/trisul_urlfilter/plugins
./mkurlfdb /tmp/shallalist /usr/local/share/trisul/plugins/DemoURLFilterDB.tch
</pre>


%(label label-danger)Note% Next, restart Trisul for the new blacklist to take effect.
