# Setup Trisul with Netflow

This section describes how you can setup Trisul to accept Netflow or Netflow “like” measurements IPFIX, JFLOW, SFLOW.

Trisul supports Netflow v5 and Netflow v9, all versions of SFLOW, and IPFIX.

## Introduction to Netflow for Trisul

Netflow is a very useful mechanism to acquire network data. In situations where direct packet monitoring is not feasible, you should use Netflow. You can even configure Trisul to use both Netflow and Raw Packets to ensure you have maximum coverage.

Please view the [Configuring Trisul with Netflow](https://trisul.org/docs/ug/netflow/index.html) guide for more information.
