h1.  Installing a new License  

This section describes how you can install a new License File to replace the default "Free 3-day":/free rolling window license. 

h2.  Introduction to Trisul Licensing

Trisul Network Analytics licenses are :
# Perpetual
# Need one license per physical node
# Tied to a machine ID 

License types are :

# Free 3-Day License : The free license gives you tremendous value as it gets you all of the real time analytics and the most recent 3 days for historical analysis
# Production License : depends on the number of active internal endpoints in your Home Network space
## Small Business : 500 simultaneously active Internal IPs
## Medium : 2000 simultaneously active Internal IPs
## Unlimited : As many as your hardware can support
