h1. How to upgrade 6.5 production license 

Trisul customers who are running production systems need to first contact us and obtain an upgraded Trisul Network Analytics 7.0 Production license first.


Merely updating packages without getting a new production license will result in an error like the following

<pre>
	<code>
*********************************************************************
*

   VERSION 6.5 PRODUCTION LICENSE detected                          
   Trisul Network Analytics Version 7.0 will not install over an    
   existing PRODUCTION license.                                     

   Please install on a fresh machine or request an upgrade license  
   from Trisul Network Analytics https://trisul.org
