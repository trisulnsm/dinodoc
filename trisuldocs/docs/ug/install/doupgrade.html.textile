h1.  Upgrading Trisul 

An upgrade is simply an uninstall followed by a new install.

p(autohint info-circle info). 
Upgrading Trisul preserves all installation, application settings, and traffic data. 

Typically it will look like the following

h2. Ubuntu 

Remove and add the meta package 


<pre class="language-bash">
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove trisul-full
sudo apt-get install trisul-full
</pre>

or you can upgrade individual packages 

<pre class="language-bash">
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get remove trisul-hub 
sudo apt-get install trisul-hub
</pre>


h2. CentOS/RHEL

For CentOS/RHEL the instructions are similar, 

<pre class="language-bash">
yum group remove 'Trisul Full'
yum group install 'Trisul Full'
</pre>

If you are getting an error with using the Group commands, try upgrading individual packages. You can even put them all on a single line  

<pre class="language-bash">
yum  remove trisul-hub trisul-probe webtrisul
yum  install trisul-hub trisul-probe webtrisul
</pre>
