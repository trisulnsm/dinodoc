## Logging

Logs are arranged in a ring of files, with patterns like `fs`, `ns`, `is` etc.

| Parameters           | Defaults                  | Description      |
| ---|---|---|
| Logdir               | /usr/local/var/log/trisul | Where the log files are stored. |

## StatsEngine

Controls the database storage and retention policy for Trisul.

| Parameters               | Defaults | Description |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| FTSFlushBudget           | 5        | TrisulFTS(Full Text Resources) need to complete the Flush operation within these many seconds. Since Trisul is a Real time system, we have a total about about 60 seconds for the entire snapshot window to flush. |
| JournalMode              | WAL      | Trisul Resources are stored in SQLITE3 leaf nodes.|
| OfflineAnalysisQueueSize | 2000000  | When importing PCAPs or other offline formats, this parameter controls the Hi Water mark of the items on the queue of the Hub. This helps to control memory usage on the Hub Node.|

### SlicePolicy

Controls data location and retention policy.

| Parameters  | Defaults | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SliceWindow | DAILY    | How much data is contained in a single slice. The available choices are :<br/>`HOURLY`From 00 Min to 59 Min every hour<br/>`DAILY`From 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM every day |

### Operational

| Parameters   | Defaults | Description|
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| SliceCount   | 32       | 32 slices are kept in the operational area. Combined with the default SliceWindow ofDAILY. This means 32 days worth of data in the oper area. Slices older than 32 days will slide over to the reference area. |
| UsageRedMark |          | Generate an alert when the disk usage percent exceeds this value for admin purposes. Leave blank or zero to disable disk usage alerting. Default disabled.|

### Reference

| Parameters   | Defaults | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| SliceCount   | 32       | Controls how many slices are kept in the reference area. If you set this to 0, the slices will then move straight from operational to archive. |
| UsageRedMark |          | Generate an alert when the disk usage percent exceeds this value for admin purposes. Leave blank or zero to disable disk usage alerting        |

### Archive

For long term storage mostly for compliance purposes.

| Parameters   | Defaults | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| SliceCount   | 32       | Controls how many slices are kept in the archive area. If you set this to 0, slices move directly to /dev/null (ie are deleted).        |
| UsageRedMark | 95       | Generate an alert when the disk usage percent exceeds this value for admin purposes. Leave blank or zero to disable disk usage alerting |

### Extra archives

An optional feature for advanced users allows for extra archives for example to be mounted to slower storage. These are disabled by default. Change the name of the node from`ExtraArchives_Disabled`to`ExtraArchives`to activate this feature.

| Parameters | Defaults | Description|
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| ID         | 1        | This ID is used to access the archive mount point. ID of 1 would lead to mount point`xarchive_1` |
| SliceCount | 32       | Number of days data in this extra archive|


### Advanced Archiving

Controls archiving process

|Parameter| Defaults | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
|DeleteIfTargetDirMissing| False | Used in HA-Master-Slave configuration with shared SAN mount point where the cold archive is stored   . In this architecture, both the HA-Master and HA-Slave store the hot and or warm data but the archive for cold data is mounted in only the current HA-Master.  Set this paramter to true on the HA-Slave node, so that if the archive SAN mount point is not available then the slice is deleted. This is correct behavior because the HA-Master which has the SAN mounted will use its normal archiving procedure to move data from hot to cold archive|
|OfflineArchiveTag||Enables offline archives. The Trisul Archiver process does not delete entries from its database mapping slices to dates and storage pools. Instead it simply tags them with this label. Set this to `tape` if you want to enable Tape archives. This maps to a `tape` subdirectory in the meters area. |



## Flushers

This section controls how many backend flushers are used. The default number of flushers used by Trisul isTWO. This is an advanced tuning parameter. You can increase the number of flushers up to eight for large to very large deployments of Trisul.

| Parameters     | Defaults | Description        |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ServerImage    |          | Path to trisul_flushd                            |
| PIDFile        |          | Where thePIDfor the running trisul_flushd process is stored        |
| AutoStart      | true     | Automatically start flushd process        
| ControlChannel |          | InternalIPCchannel      |
| Flushers       |          | For each flusher instance specify the connection and DB instance number. Sequentially from 0..8 (MAX). See below |

### Flusher

Flushers are backend databases processes that store data snapshots coming from the Probes into a slice. The number of flushers must be a multiple of 2. Valid values are 1,2,4,8.   A typical flusher section would be

```xml
<Flushers>
    <Flusher>
        <Connection>tcp://192.168.10.12:12001</Connection>
        <DBInstance>0</DBInstance>
    </Flusher>
    <Flusher>
        <Connection>tcp://192.168.10.12:12002</Connection>
        <DBInstance>1</DBInstance>
    </Flusher>
</Flushers>
```

- Connection : A network endpoint, the default single machine endpoint uses IPC, the form of socket is `ipc://` , there is an attribute `dedicated` that can be used to dedicate a flusher to a single probe and a single instance. See next section. 
- DBInstance : 0, 1, 2, etc. 


#### Dedicated to probe connection flusher

In multi probe very high volume environments consider using the `dedicated="probe0"` probe flusher format.

```xml
<Flusher>
    <Connection dedicated="probe0">tcp://192.168.1.2:12003</Connection>
    <Connection dedicated="probe1">tcp://192.168.1.2:12023</Connection>
    <Connection dedicated="probe2">tcp://192.168.1.2:12043</Connection>
    <DBInstance>
        0
    </DBInstance>
</Flusher>
```

The `<Conenection dedicated="probe0">` format sets up a dedicated endpoint for a probe and an instance. Without it, all probes would use the same endpoint and the messaging framework would demultiplex it.  A performance setting. 

## Server

Controls theTRPServer Process used for database querying functionality. The process that provides the queryAPIis called trisul_trpd@

| Parameters      | Defaults | Description          |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| ZmqConnection   |          | The port running theTRPProtocol where you can connect and query the trisul database. By default, this is anIPCsocket`ipc:///usr/local/var/lib/trisul-hub/domain0/hub0/context0/run/trp_0`. You can change this parameter to allow a remoteTCPconnection.Example: To allow queries usingTCPPort 12004<br/><br/><br/><br/>1. Change this parameter to`tcp://10.0.0.23:12004`where`10.0.0.23`is the IP address of theHUBnode<br/><br/>2. Then restart the context like so`trisulctl_hub restart context default@hub0`<br/><br/> |
| PIDFile         |          | Where thePIDof the running trisul_trpd process is stored     |
| NumServers      | 6        | Number of backend servers to start. |
| ParallelQueries | false    | Whether parallel queries must be turned on for all queries. The defautl is false, use this only when you have the database stored on different spindles.   |

## Probes

Add probes that are allowed to connect to this context.

Each probe is a line with the following details.

| Parameters | Defaults | Description                                             |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layer      |          | Layer number allocated to the probe.                    |
| ProbeID    |          | ProbeID eg,`probe0`this probe must be authenticated by aCURVEcertificate earlier for the domain this hub belongs to. See*trisulctl_hub install probe* |

## DBTasks

Control the various database maintenance tasks. These tasks are scheduled internally by Trisul at fixed intervals.

### Archiver

Archiver is responsible for sliding old data.

| Parameters | Defaults | Description           |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Enable     | TRUE     | Archiving is enabled. |

### SummSlice

Slices data is summarized so that reporting on total entities are fast.

| Parameters | Defaults | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable     | TRUE     | Fine grained daily summary calculation of per group disk storage. |

### CacheBuild

Database optimizer task to pack frequently used keys to speed up long range time series operations.

| Parameters  | Defaults | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable      | TRUE     | Archiving is enabled                                                    |
| TopKeyCount | 25       | The top 25 keys in each metric can be selected for faster retrieval     |
| InKeyCount  | 100      | In addition to the toppers, these many keys can be selected for caching |

### ResolveIP

This section controls the automatic IP address resolver.

How IP Address resolution works

- Runs at fixed intervals automatically, typically every 15 minutes or so.
- In Packet Capture mode , all IP address to hostnames are harvested fromDNSpackets automatically
- In Netflow mode , the most important IP addresses that appears in “topper lists” are resolved usingDNSlookup.

```xml
<ResolveIP>
        <Enable> True </Enable>
        <Debug> True </Debug>
        <Candidates>
            <Internal>100</Internal>
            <External>25</External>
        </Candidates>
        <AlwaysRefreshInternal>false</AlwaysRefreshInternal>
        <AlwaysRefreshExternal>false</AlwaysRefreshExternal>
 </ResolveIP>
```

| Parameters            | Defaults | Description  |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Enable                | TRUE     | Most important / visible IPs are resolved |
| Debug                 | TRUE     | Prints resolved IPs for debugging purposes in`t_resolveip.log`file    |
| Candidates            |          | Number of Top-K items per meter for Internal IPs vs External IPs. Internal IPs are those which fall into your Home |
| AlwaysRefreshExternal | false    | Do a full refresh of External IPs. Normally, the resolver does not keep trying to resolve IPs that fail to resolve or those IPs which have already been recently resolved. |
| AlwaysRefreshInternal | false    | Do a full refresh of Internal IPs. Use this option if you have an enterprise with dynamically changing IP → User names. |

### CleanPersist

The persist storage area collects key related information – such as IP to host name mappings etc. Over a long period of time this can grow to huge proportions. The*CleanPersist*process prunes this storage area by randomly deleting 2% of keys each run.

| Parameters | Defaults | Description          |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Enable     | TRUE     | Archiving is enabled |

### CatTrf

A database packer algorithm to speed up database reads and to defragement files.

| Parameters | Defaults | Description          |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Enable     | TRUE     | Archiving is enabled |

### Rebucketizer

When Rebucketizer is enabled, additional shadow timeseries resolutions are added to allow fast retrieval of very long timewindow data.  In this section, you should specify the resolutions you want added.  

![](images/rebucketizer.png)  
*Figure: Showing Rebucketizer*


| Parameters | Defaults | Description          |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Enable     | TRUE     | Rebucketizer is enabled |
| ID         | 1        | Unique identifier for each configuration or bucket. The resolution is stored under `resol.1`  and `resol.2` etc|
| BucketSize | 300      | The size of the bucket in seconds   |
| TopperBucketSize | 900 | The size of the topper bucket in seconds  |
| ThresholdDays | 10 | Use this resolution if the query time window is greater than this number of days |
| TopperClipBelow | 0 | Remove items in topper table if metric value is below this number. The default is 0 , to not clip anything. |

So here by default, for ID=1, the bucket size for 1 day is partitioned into 5 minutes(300 seconds) interval and the topper bucket size for 1 day is partitioned into 15 minutes (900 seconds) interval and so on.


## IPDR

These parameters are for the IPDR Service. IPDR is the IP Detailed Record logging service. This is a mode of storing very large number of raw flows for compliance and query purposes.


:::tip Set automatically
These parameters are typically set automatically when you put Trisul in the IPDR mode.

| SubscriberOption | | Add Subscriber ID or other ISP specific tag , this is taken from the RADIUS AAA log files |
| MaxRecords | 250,000 | When using the *Request Full Database Dump* this parameter controls the maximum number of records dumped.  | 
| QueryThreadCount |1 | Number of worker query threads to use for IPDR queries, ideal value is the same  _numflushers*numprobes_  This maps to `--threads,-j` parameter in trisul_queryflowstream tool  |
| MACInDeviceID | false| Put the MAC Address in the device ID field which normally contain the router iD |

## Advanced DB Parameters

Database parameters to optimize. Generally these need to be only changed for very large deployments which are facing significant performance issues. The following table lists some parameters that might be useful.

Under the node : `DBParameters > FlowStream`


:::tip Tuning Notes
 * The tuning for FlowStream shown below consists essentially of tweaking the size of the underlying Bloom Filters and Bitmap Index datastructures for hosts, applications, tags etc.
 * All values must be powers of two.  Enter 32768 instead of 32K
 * To disable a particular index enter `0` for the corresponding value
 * To use default just leave the value blank
 * The hash used is Murmur-3 
 * These values can be changed at any time, they are stored on a per-block basis

| Parameter                  | Default  | Type | Description   |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ---  | ---------------------|
| MicroSecondTimestamps      | TRUE     | |Does the flow database need microsecond timestamps. Use case : Compliance for large flow stores. Disabling microsecond timestamps for start and end time can save about 8 bytes / per flow | 
| ZFLOWBLOCK_COMPRESSOR_CODE | lz4      | |The compressor type for the flow database. Available parameter values are<ul> <li>`lz4`</li><li>`lz4-ip-call-log-with-nat-pro-max` : For both IPv4 and IPv6 withNATIP, Port, userid for full log</li><li>`lz4-ip-call-log-with-nat-pro-max-mac` : With MAC ID collection, use only when you are sure MAC ID represent end user terminals</li></ul> |
