# Netflow Configuration File

## How to edit

On the Trisul-Probe type `sudo /usr/local/share/trisul-probe/cfgedit` then select “Netflow” to edit.  See [Plugin Configuration](/docs/ref/plugin_configuration.html)

## Location

In a file called `PI-7CA09636-02D4-45E7-AA00-BE0D49B94E26.xml` in `/usr/local/etc/trisul-probe/domainX/probeX/contextX` You can edit the config file directly by typing the full file name as shown below

```bash
# vi /usr/local/etc/trisul-probe/domain0/probe0/context0/PI-7CA09636-02D4-45E7-AA00-BE0D49B94E26.xml 
```

## Parameters

These are the parameters that control Netflow processing.

:::note Case insensitive

Boolean parameters are case-insensitive. True, true, TRUE mean the same thing

| MeterApplications           | TRUE     | Whether or not traffic stats for each application is metered. In this context application refers to the UDP/TCP port or to special network level apps like ICMP, IPSEC, etc. In case of TCP/UDP ports, the default behavior is to only meter the lower numbered port. This works in most cases, but if you want to count both ports, set the MeterBothPorts parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| IgnoreV9EgressFromDevices   |          | Sometimes we find that customers erroneously enable both Netflow v9 INGRESS and EGRESS on all ports. This will result in double counting. The solution is to only configure INGRESS+EGRESS on a single port such as the uplink ports. Oftentimes, we are unable to get the Netflow change request done. This option allows you to adjust for this. This option contains a comma separated list of IP addresses of devices from which Trisul will ignore EGRESS netflow V9 records. The following example ignores Netflow v9 EGRESS from two devices <br/>`<IgnoreV9EgressFromDevices>172.16.13.31,172.16.13.36`<br/>Egress flow records are those with NF9/IPFIX direction field with value=1 |

## Sampling rates

Flow sampling is a technique used by very busy devices to reduce CPU load. If you confiygure a sampling rate of *128*, the device will only process every 128 packets. In IPFIX technologies the sampling rate is typically sent in an *options template*. This section provides a manual way to configure sampling rates per router in the event you are not able to setup the options template. This is not a replacement for configuring sampling on the router or enabling the options template.

Add a separate line for each router as shown below

```html
<SamplingRates>
    <Rate router="180.179.9.2"   rate="128"  />
</SamplingRates>
```

### Default sampling rate

To create a default sampling rate for all routers which do not have an explicit sampling rate set, use the IP address 0.0.0.0. For example to configure a sampling rate of 1000 for all routers. Use 

```html
<SamplingRates>
    <Rate router="180.180.9.2"   rate="128"  />
    <Rate router="0.0.0.0"   rate="1000"  />
</SamplingRates>
```

### Static Templates

Typically you dont need to use this section. We have used this section in the past to address various firmware bugs in some devices which did not export Netflow templates correctly. Templates fields specified in this section will override those received on the network.
