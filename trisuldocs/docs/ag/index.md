# Trisul Adminstrator Guide

Welcome to the Trisul **Administrator Guide**! 

If you’re setting up Trisul for the first time, this is exactly where you should start. All [**four Trisul products**](/docs/ag/install/selectmode) run on the same core platform, so the setup and first-time guidance steps you’ll see here apply across every product. 

:::tip
As you move through the **Admin Guide**, you’ll notice that it’s structured in a sequence that follows the recommended setup flow. Each section builds on the previous one, so it’s best to read and complete them in order to ensure your Trisul deployment is configured correctly before moving on to product-specific documentation.

- System Requirements
