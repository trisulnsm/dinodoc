# NetFlow Template DB

Netflow v9, IPFIX, JFlow, Netstream are technologies that use a concept
of Template records. These are special records sent by the router which
describe the metrics contained in normal data flow records. Viewing
these template records are a great way to troubleshoot Netflow.

This Menu provides Netflow/IPFIX template database received by all
probes.

You can see the template database on each probe. This is updated every
10 minutes or when a new template is received.
