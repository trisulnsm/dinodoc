# Users

Manage users and their access levels.

## Types of Users

A brand new install of Trisul has two users pre-provisioned

- **admin** - username `admin` and password `admin`

The `admin` login must be used to perform all tasks that involve system
configuration change, starting and stopping Trisul processes, user and
role management.

- **user** - username `user` and password `user`

The `user` login is for all other operations like viewing and scheduling
reports, packet analysis, viewing alerts, and pretty much everything
else a normal operator would do on a regular basis.
