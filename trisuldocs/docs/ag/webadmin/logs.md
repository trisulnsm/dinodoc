## Log Directory

If you want the raw webserver log it can be found on the Trisul Hub
server at `/usr/local/var/log/trisul-hub/webtrisul`  
The files are named production.log or productionssl.log (if you are
running webtrisul on HTTPS)

Also see `trisbashrc:â€œ/docs/ref/trisbashrc.html` which contains helper
aliases to locate various log files on the probe and hub server systems.
