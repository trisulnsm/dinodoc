# Rolling Cards

Rolling Cards provide a carousel-like display of top performers from selected countergroups. This feature allows users to choose multiple metrics for a countergroup, which are then displayed separately in distinct rolling cards, enabling a comprehensive and organized view of key performance indicators.
