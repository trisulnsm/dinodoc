# About trisul installation

Trisul is a distributed monitoring system with a number of
`trisul-probe` instances all reporting back to one or more `trisul-hub`.
We first explain how you can install all components on a single box and
then slowly expand to explore distributed installation.

This section covers how to get a *single box* install of Trisul up and
running. For distributed installation see [Distributed monitoring](/docs/ag/domain/index)
